# Topic: Federal IRS 501(c)(7) Compliance

## Definition

This topic identifies the requirements of federal tax law that apply to the organization as an IRS-recognized 501(c)(7) social club and ensures the By-Laws reflect and support that status. It answers:

- What organizational and operational tests must the organization satisfy to qualify as a 501(c)(7) social club?
- What restrictions apply to the source and composition of the organization's gross receipts (member vs. non-member income)?
- What activities are prohibited or restricted under 501(c)(7) status, including political campaign intervention and private inurement?
- What annual IRS filing obligations apply (Form 990 / 990-EZ / 990-N), and who is responsible for ensuring timely filing?
- What record-keeping requirements exist for federal tax purposes?
- Does the organization's membership eligibility criteria comply with IRS non-discrimination requirements under 501(c)(7)?
- What happens to the organization's 501(c)(7) status upon dissolution, and how must remaining assets be distributed?
- Are there any activities (e.g., fundraising for non-members, sponsorships, advertising) that could generate unrelated business income (UBIT) subject to tax?

Note: This topic interacts closely with Topic 06 (California Law Compliance), Topic 07 (Financial Management), Topic 04 (Membership and Eligibility), and Topic 12 (Dissolution). Federal tax requirements may impose constraints on membership rules, financial practices, and winding-down procedures.
