# Policy Questions: Federal IRS 501(c)(7) Compliance

These are the questions the organization must answer before drafting the federal tax compliance provisions of the revised By-Laws. Each question reflects a real policy choice within the constraints imposed by IRS rules.

## 1. Should the By-Laws explicitly state the organization's 501(c)(7) tax-exempt status?

The current By-Laws do not acknowledge any specific federal tax classification.
- Should the By-Laws include a statement that the organization is organized and operated as a tax-exempt social club under Section 501(c)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code?
- Does the organization in fact hold a current IRS determination letter recognizing it as a 501(c)(7) organization — and if not, should obtaining one be a near-term organizational priority?
- Should the By-Laws include language committing the organization to operate in a manner consistent with 501(c)(7) requirements, so that the Board has a clear fiduciary duty to protect tax-exempt status?

## 2. Who is responsible for preparing and filing the annual IRS Form 990?

The Treasurer currently has no explicit duty to file with the IRS, even though this is a legal obligation.
- Should the By-Laws explicitly assign responsibility for annual IRS filings to the Treasurer?
- Should a CPA or tax professional be engaged to prepare the Form 990, and should the Board authorize this expense in the annual budget?
- Should the President or the full Board be required to review and approve the Form 990 before it is filed?
- Should there be a Board-level checkup each year confirming that the filing was made — and a consequence if no one confirms this?

## 3. How should the organization monitor its gross receipts composition to maintain 501(c)(7) compliance?

IRS rules require that at least 65% of gross receipts come from members and that non-member income not exceed 35% (with non-member use of club resources capped at 15%).
- Should the Treasurer be required to track member vs. non-member revenue separately throughout the year and report on the composition in the annual financial report?
- Should the Board be required to review gross receipts composition before approving any activity or partnership that would generate non-member income?
- Should there be a defined threshold — for example, if non-member income reaches 25% of gross receipts in any year, the Treasurer must alert the Board to take corrective action before the limit is breached?

## 4. What activities involving non-members should be permitted, and what guardrails should apply?

Certain activities the organization might naturally pursue — selling event tickets to non-members, accepting corporate sponsorships, renting out its event space, advertising in its newsletter — can all generate non-member income that counts against the 35% cap.
- Should the organization establish a policy limiting the scope of non-member ticket sales or event participation?
- Should the By-Laws or an implementing policy require Board approval before the organization accepts a corporate sponsorship or large donation from a non-member entity?
- Should the organization avoid advertising in its communications entirely, to eliminate UBIT (Unrelated Business Income Tax) exposure from that source?
- If UBIT-generating income arises unexpectedly, who is responsible for identifying it and ensuring tax is paid?

## 5. Should the By-Laws include an explicit private inurement prohibition?

IRS 501(c)(7) status requires that no net earnings inure to the benefit of any private individual.
- Should the By-Laws include an explicit statement that no part of the organization's net earnings shall inure to the benefit of any individual member, director, or officer — beyond reasonable compensation for services actually rendered and board-approved expense reimbursements?
- Should this prohibition be stated in the purposes article or in a separate compliance article?

---

## 6. Should the By-Laws include a non-discrimination statement?

IRS policy requires 501(c)(7) organizations to refrain from discriminating on the basis of race, color, or religion in their written policies and practices.
- Should the By-Laws include an explicit statement that the organization does not discriminate in membership or participation on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, or other protected characteristics?
- Should the non-discrimination statement be limited to the minimum IRS requirement (race, color, religion) or should it be broader to reflect contemporary values?
- Does the membership eligibility criterion (SCUT alumni or students) itself need to be reviewed to ensure it is facially neutral and does not function as a proxy for prohibited discrimination?

---

## 7. What should the By-Laws say about record retention for federal tax purposes?

IRS rules require organizations to retain records sufficient to support their tax filings and demonstrate compliance with 501(c)(7) requirements.
- Should the By-Laws specify a minimum retention period for financial records — for example, seven years from the date of the relevant tax filing?
- Should the By-Laws require that copies of all Form 990 filings be retained permanently as part of the organization's official records?
- Should the IRS determination letter (if one exists) and all correspondence with the IRS be retained permanently?

---

## 8. What should happen if the organization loses its 501(c)(7) status?

Under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, an organization that fails to file its Form 990 for three consecutive years automatically loses its tax-exempt status. This can happen without the Board realizing it.
- Should the By-Laws include a provision addressing what to do if the organization's tax-exempt status is revoked — specifically, who is responsible for initiating the reinstatement process?
- Should there be a Board-level procedure for checking the organization's status on the IRS Tax Exempt Organization Search database annually?
- Should the loss of tax-exempt status trigger an automatic special Board meeting to address the issue within a defined timeframe (e.g., 30 days of learning of the revocation)?
