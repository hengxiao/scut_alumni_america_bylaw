# Status Quo: Federal IRS 501(c)(7) Compliance

## What the Current By-Laws Say

**Article I §2:** States that the organization is incorporated in California as a Non-Profit Mutual Benefit Corporation. No mention of federal tax-exempt status or IRS classification.

**Article III §3:** States that the organization "shall not participate in political activities or activities that jeopardize its tax-exempt status." This is the only indirect acknowledgment of a federal tax-exempt status.

**Article IV — Memberships:** Defines membership eligibility as alumni or students of South China University of Technology. No reference to how membership limits relate to federal tax requirements.

**Article VII — Organization Fund:** Requires funds to be deposited in a federally insured financial institution. No reference to IRS reporting, record-keeping, or unrelated business income.

No other provisions reference federal tax law, IRS regulations, or 501(c)(7) requirements.

## Gaps and Observations

### 1. No Explicit Acknowledgment of 501(c)(7) Status
The By-Laws do not state that the organization operates as a 501(c)(7) social club under the Internal Revenue Code. This omission makes it difficult to assess whether the organizational documents support the claimed tax-exempt status and may complicate any IRS inquiry.

### 2. No Gross Receipts Composition Rules
IRS 501(c)(7) requires that:
- At least 65% of gross receipts come from members (dues, initiation fees, assessments).
- Investment income and non-member income together may not exceed 35% of gross receipts.
- Income from non-members using club facilities/services may not exceed 15% of gross receipts.

The current By-Laws contain no awareness of these thresholds, no mechanism to monitor gross receipt composition, and no policy limiting non-member activities or revenue.

### 3. No Private Inurement Prohibition
IRS 501(c)(7) prohibits any part of the organization's net earnings from inuring to the benefit of any private individual. The By-Laws do not contain an explicit inurement prohibition. While the non-profit nature of the organization implies this, an explicit prohibition is standard practice and may be required for IRS recognition.

### 4. No Annual Filing Obligation Assigned
Organizations with 501(c)(7) status must file annually with the IRS:
- Form 990-N (e-Postcard) if gross receipts ≤ $50,000
- Form 990-EZ if gross receipts < $200,000 and total assets < $500,000
- Form 990 if gross receipts ≥ $200,000 or total assets ≥ $500,000

The current By-Laws assign no responsibility to any officer or committee for ensuring annual IRS filings. The Treasurer's duty to "submit an annual account of the organization" (Article VI §5) does not address federal filing obligations.

### 5. No IRS Record-Keeping Requirements
IRS regulations require organizations to retain records sufficient to substantiate gross receipts, expenses, and activities. No record retention requirements—financial or otherwise—appear in the current By-Laws. (See also Topic 07 — Financial Management.)

### 6. No Non-Discrimination Statement
IRS policy prohibits recognition of 501(c)(7) status for organizations whose written governing documents or practices discriminate based on race, color, or religion. The current By-Laws contain no non-discrimination statement. While the membership criteria (SCUT alumni/students) are facially neutral, the absence of any explicit non-discrimination clause is a gap.

### 7. No Unrelated Business Income (UBIT) Awareness
If the organization earns income from activities not substantially related to its 501(c)(7) purpose—such as advertising in newsletters, renting event venues to non-members, or corporate sponsorships—that income may be subject to Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT) under IRC §511–514. The current By-Laws contain no guidance on this issue, nor any mechanism for identifying or managing UBIT exposure.

### 8. Dissolution and Asset Distribution Not Addressed
Upon dissolution, IRS rules require that assets of a tax-exempt organization not be distributed to members for their private benefit. The current By-Laws contain no dissolution procedures and no restriction on asset distribution. This is a compliance gap for both federal tax purposes and California law. (See also Topic 12 — Dissolution.)

### 9. No Process for Loss or Reinstatement of Tax-Exempt Status
The By-Laws do not address what happens if the organization fails to file for three consecutive years (automatic revocation under the Pension Protection Act of 2006) or otherwise loses its 501(c)(7) status, nor how status could be reinstated.

## Summary

The current By-Laws make no meaningful reference to the organization's federal tax obligations or 501(c)(7) compliance requirements. A revised By-Laws should at minimum:

- Explicitly acknowledge 501(c)(7) status and the purpose of maintaining it.
- Assign responsibility for annual IRS filings (Form 990 series).
- Include an explicit private inurement prohibition.
- Include a non-discrimination statement.
- Establish awareness of gross receipts composition rules and UBIT exposure.
- Address asset distribution upon dissolution consistent with federal tax requirements.
