## How the 10 Reference Organizations Handle IRS Compliance

### Preliminary Note: IRS Status Distribution

The 10 reference organizations span multiple IRS statuses:

| Organization | IRS Status | Primary Relevance to 501(c)(7) Analysis |
|---|---|---|
| PUAASC | 501(c)(7) social club | **Closest analog — same status as SCUT** |
| PKUAA-NE | 501(c)(3) charitable | Instructive comparison |
| USTCAF | 501(c)(3) charitable | Instructive comparison |
| FDAAGLA | Unknown / likely 501(c)(7) | Comparable |
| XTUAANA | Likely 501(c)(7) | Closest template — same gaps |
| CTUAAA | Unknown | Less relevant |
| SJTU-SV | 501(c)(3) charitable | Instructive for potential conversion |
| HCSSA | Student org (no IRS tax-exempt) | Not relevant |
| TAAGNY | 501(c)(3) charitable | Instructive for potential conversion |
| OCA | 501(c)(3) charitable | Not directly relevant |

**Most Directly Relevant:** PUAASC and XTUAANA (same 501(c)(7)/mutual benefit form as SCUT Alumni America).

## Part 1: Understanding 501(c)(7) Requirements

### What 501(c)(7) Permits

A 501(c)(7) "social club" organization:
- Is organized for the **pleasure, recreation, and social activities** of its members
- May earn investment income (interest, dividends) without paying tax on it
- Members may not deduct dues or contributions to the organization as charitable gifts
- Is **not** required to serve the public — members' benefit is the primary purpose

### The 65%/35% Rule

The most critical IRS requirement for 501(c)(7) organizations is the **gross receipts test**:
- At least **65%** of gross receipts must come from **member sources** (dues, member event fees, assessments)
- No more than **35%** of gross receipts may come from **investment income and public/non-member sources** combined
- No more than **15%** of gross receipts may come from **non-member use** of the organization's facilities/activities

**Why This Matters for SCUT Alumni America:**
If the organization hosts events that are open to non-members (guests, sponsors, Chinese community members who are not SCUT alumni), the revenue from those events counts against the 35% non-member limit. If the organization has significant sponsorship revenue from corporations (non-members), this is also non-member income.

**Bylaw Provisions That Help Maintain 501(c)(7) Status:**
1. Explicitly limiting primary activities to member benefit
2. Ensuring events are primarily for members (with guest provisions limited)
3. Not accepting public charitable donations (which would be non-member income and also would not be tax-deductible)

## Part 2: Provisions Found in 501(c)(7) Bylaws

### PUAASC (Most Relevant Reference Organization)

PUAASC is a California Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation with IRS 501(c)(7) status — the same legal form and IRS classification as SCUT Alumni America. PUAASC's bylaws include these 501(c)(7)-relevant provisions:

**Member Benefit Language:**
> "The purposes of this Association are: to promote the social, cultural, and educational welfare of its members; to foster fellowship and mutual assistance among Peking University alumni in Southern California; and to support the educational mission of Peking University."

This language centers on member benefit ("its members"), which is appropriate for 501(c)(7).

**Non-Distribution Clause:**
> "No part of the net earnings of the Association shall inure to the benefit of any member or private person."

This is required for all tax-exempt organizations, including 501(c)(7). SCUT Alumni America's bylaws should include this or equivalent language.

**Non-Partisan Clause:**
> "The Association shall not participate in any political campaign on behalf of, or in opposition to, any candidate for public office."

This is required for 501(c)(7) organizations (though the standard is somewhat different from the absolute prohibition on 501(c)(3)s).

### XTUAANA (Nearest Template to SCUT — With Gaps)

XTUAANA (Xiangtan University Alumni Association of North America) likely uses the same bylaw template as SCUT Alumni America. It is a California Public Benefit Corporation — a notable discrepancy with SCUT's mutual benefit status. The XTUAANA analysis identified the following 501(c)(7)-relevant gaps:

1. **Missing non-inurement clause** — no statement that earnings do not inure to members' benefit
2. **Missing dissolution clause** — assets default to members upon dissolution (problematic for any tax-exempt org)
3. **No explicit member-benefit purpose language**

---

## Part 3: 501(c)(3) vs. 501(c)(7) — The Conversion Question

Several reference organizations have successfully operated as 501(c)(3) organizations (PKUAA-NE, SJTU-SV, TAAGNY), raising the question of whether SCUT Alumni America should consider converting from 501(c)(7) to 501(c)(3).

### Organizations That Made (or Started as) 501(c)(3)

**SJTU-SV (Bay Area, most comparable geographically):**
> Operates as a California 501(c)(3) public benefit nonprofit. This enables:
> - Tax-deductible donations from members and donors
> - Eligibility for foundation grants
> - Greater public trust and credibility
> - Scholarship programs are more natural under 501(c)(3)

**TAAGNY (est. 1982 as 501(c)(3)):**
> "Donations to TAAGNY are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law." — TAAGNY has operated as a 501(c)(3) for over 40 years, demonstrating that an alumni association can maintain public benefit status long-term.

**PKUAA-NE:**
> Uses educational and charitable framing for all activities, consistent with 501(c)(3) purposes.

### 501(c)(7) Advantages

| Advantage | Description |
|---|---|
| No public benefit test | Organization can serve members exclusively without public benefit obligation |
| No Form 990 disclosure | Smaller 501(c)(7) organizations may file 990-N (e-postcard) with minimal disclosure |
| Simpler compliance | No complex public support test required |
| Member-focused activities | Events for members only, member-benefit decisions — all clearly permitted |
| Guest participation | Members can bring guests freely without concern about non-member income percentages |

### 501(c)(3) Advantages

| Advantage | Description |
|---|---|
| Tax-deductible donations | Donors can deduct contributions; enables larger gifts and corporate sponsorships |
| Grant eligibility | Foundation grants typically require 501(c)(3) status |
| Scholarship credibility | Scholarships are most natural as 501(c)(3) activities |
| Broader public benefit | Organization can serve non-members without concern |
| More prestige | Many donors and corporate sponsors prefer 501(c)(3) partners |

### The SJTU-SV Model (Bay Area 501(c)(3))

SJTU-SV is the most directly comparable organization to SCUT Alumni America in terms of geography (Bay Area), constituency (Chinese university alumni), and activities. SJTU-SV operates as a 501(c)(3). If SCUT Alumni America ever considers conversion, SJTU-SV's bylaws provide a model for how to structure a Bay Area Chinese university alumni association as a 501(c)(3).

**Key Implication:** SJTU-SV's choice of 501(c)(3) suggests the Bay Area Chinese university alumni community may expect or prefer this status. However, converting from 501(c)(7) to 501(c)(3) requires IRS approval and significant operational changes.

## Part 4: Mandatory Bylaw Provisions for 501(c)(7) Status

### Required Bylaw Content

The following provisions should be in SCUT Alumni America's bylaws to clearly support 501(c)(7) status:

**1. Member-Benefit Purpose Statement**
> "This Association is organized and operated exclusively for the pleasure, recreation, and social activities of its members, within the meaning of Section 501(c)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code."

**2. Non-Inurement Clause**
> "No part of the net earnings of the Association shall inure to the benefit of, or be distributable to, any member, director, officer, or other private person, except that the Association may pay reasonable compensation for services rendered and make payments and distributions in furtherance of its exempt purposes."

**3. Non-Partisan Clause (Political Activity Prohibition)**
> "The Association shall not participate in, or intervene in, any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office, and shall not use any of its assets or resources for political campaign activity."

**4. Dissolution Clause (Addressed in Topic 12)**
> Distribution to 501(c)(3) organizations rather than to members (prevents problematic member-distribution default).

**5. Limitation on Non-Member Activities**
> "The primary beneficiaries of the Association's activities and resources shall be its members. Participation in Association events by non-members shall be limited to guest accompaniment by members and shall not constitute a significant portion of the Association's total activities."

## Part 5: Annual IRS Reporting (Form 990)

### Which Form to File

| Organization Size | IRS Form Required |
|---|---|
| Gross receipts normally ≤ $50,000 | Form 990-N (e-postcard) |
| Gross receipts normally $50,001–$200,000 AND total assets ≤ $500,000 | Form 990-EZ |
| Gross receipts normally > $200,000 OR total assets > $500,000 | Full Form 990 |

**For SCUT Alumni America:** Depending on annual revenues, the organization likely files Form 990-N or 990-EZ. The bylaws should ensure the Treasurer has clear authority to file and the obligation is explicit.

**Bylaw Provision:**
> "The Treasurer shall ensure that all required federal and state tax filings are made in a timely manner, including annual filings with the Internal Revenue Service and the California Franchise Tax Board."

---

## Part 6: California State Compliance (Related to Federal)

**California Franchise Tax Board:** California 501(c)(7) organizations must:
- File **Form 199** (California Exempt Organization Annual Information Return) annually
- Pay the $10 minimum franchise tax OR qualify for exemption under R&TC §23701g (California's equivalent of 501(c)(7))

**California Attorney General Requirement:**
- Organizations with gross revenues over $25,000 must register with the California Attorney General's Registry of Charitable Trusts and file Form RRF-1 annually
- Note: 501(c)(7) organizations that do not solicit charitable contributions may be exempt from this requirement

**Bylaw Provision:**
> "The officers shall ensure that the Association complies with all applicable federal and California state laws governing nonprofit corporations and tax-exempt organizations."

## Recommendations for SCUT Alumni America

### Critical (IRS Status at Risk Without These)

1. **Add a non-inurement clause.** This is legally required for all tax-exempt organizations. Without it, the bylaws fail to articulate a basic requirement of 501(c)(7) status.

2. **Add a non-partisan clause.** Required for 501(c)(7) status. Standard language prohibiting political campaign intervention.

3. **Add a dissolution clause** distributing assets to 501(c)(3) organizations (not to members). This prevents a taxable member distribution upon dissolution and is legally essential.

### High Priority

4. **Add explicit member-benefit purpose language.** The purpose statement should clearly indicate that the Association is organized for the benefit of its members — not the general public.

5. **Add Treasurer responsibility for tax filings.** Explicitly assign the Treasurer the duty to file Form 990-N/990-EZ and California Form 199 annually.

### Medium Priority

6. **Discuss 501(c)(3) conversion as a strategic policy question.** Given that Bay Area peer organizations (SJTU-SV) operate as 501(c)(3), SCUT Alumni America's leadership should make an informed decision about whether conversion is desirable. If yes, the bylaw revision should prepare the organization for conversion. If no, the current 501(c)(7) structure should be maintained and explicitly reinforced.

7. **Establish an annual gross receipts review.** The Board should review total revenues annually to ensure compliance with the 65%/35% member-income rule. If non-member income (sponsorships, public event revenue) is approaching 35% of gross receipts, action is needed.
