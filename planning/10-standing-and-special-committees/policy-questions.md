# Policy Questions: Standing and Special Committees

These are the questions the organization must answer before drafting the committees article of the revised By-Laws. Each question reflects a real policy choice rather than a legal requirement.

## 1. What standing committees, if any, should be formally established in the By-Laws?

Currently the organization has no committee structure at all. The organization should decide which committees are important enough to be enshrined in the By-Laws vs. left to the Board to create as needed.
- Should a Finance Committee be established as a standing committee to oversee the Treasurer's work and review annual financial reports?
- Should an Election Committee (or Nominating Committee) be established to administer the nomination and election process independently of the incumbent leadership?
- Should an Events Committee be established to coordinate the organization's annual and special events?
- Should a Membership Committee be established to manage the membership roll, process applications, and follow up on lapsed dues?
- Are there other standing committees that reflect the organization's regular activities (e.g., a Communications Committee, a Scholarship Committee, a SCUT Relations Committee)?

## 2. Who has authority to create and dissolve committees?

- Should the Board of Directors have sole authority to create standing committees and special (ad hoc) committees?
- Should the President / Chairman be able to create a special committee unilaterally for short-term tasks, subject to later Board ratification?
- What is the process for dissolving a standing committee — does it require the same vote as creating it?

## 3. How are committee members appointed, and what are their terms?

- Should committee members be appointed by the President, the Board, or both?
- Should committee members be required to be current members in good standing, or can non-members serve in an advisory or functional capacity (e.g., a volunteer who is not a dues-paying member)?
- Should committee terms be aligned with officer terms, or should committees be able to maintain continuity across officer transitions?
- Is there a maximum size for a committee, and is there a minimum?

## 4. Who chairs each committee, and how is the chair selected?

- Should each committee's chair be appointed by the President, elected by the committee members, or automatically assigned to a specific officer (e.g., the Treasurer chairs the Finance Committee)?
- Should committee chairs report directly to the President, the full Board, or both?
- Can a committee chair be a non-officer Board member, or must it be an officer?

---

## 5. What authority does a committee have, and what decisions remain with the Board?

- Can a committee take binding action on its own, or can it only make recommendations to the Board?
- Should spending authority be delegated to specific committees (e.g., the Events Committee may spend up to a Board-approved budget without individual transaction approvals)?
- Can a committee enter into contracts or commitments on behalf of the organization, or is that authority reserved for the President and/or Treasurer?

---

## 6. How does a committee report to the Board and to the membership?

- Should each standing committee be required to provide a written report at every regular Board meeting?
- Should a committee's annual report be presented at the annual membership meeting?
- Should committee meeting minutes or summaries be distributed to the full Board?
- Should committees be accessible to any member who wishes to attend their meetings or review their work?

---

## 7. Should there be a defined structure for special (ad hoc) committees?

Special committees are created for a specific, time-limited purpose (e.g., organizing the 20th anniversary gala, reviewing a proposed partnership, selecting a new bank).
- Should the creation of a special committee require a Board vote, or can the President create one by executive action?
- Should the special committee's charter (purpose, scope, timeline, composition) be documented in writing?
- Should a special committee automatically dissolve when its task is complete, or must it be formally disbanded by the Board?
- Should members of a special committee be eligible to receive reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses, and if so, under what process?
