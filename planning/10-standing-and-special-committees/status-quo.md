# Status Quo: Standing and Special Committees

## What the Current By-Laws Say

The current By-Laws contain no provisions for committees of any kind.

**Closest relevant language:**
- Article V §3(d): The Board of Directors has the duty to "appoint executive officers" — this is the only appointment power mentioned.
- Article V §3(e): The Board has the duty to "plan various activities" — in practice this may be delegated to informal working groups, but there is no By-Law basis for this.

## Gaps and Observations

- No committee structure exists in the By-Laws whatsoever.
- Any committees the organization currently operates (e.g., events committee, finance committee) have no formal standing.
- No rules govern the authority, composition, or accountability of such groups.
- No process for creating or dissolving a committee.
- No requirement for committees to report to the Board or to members.
