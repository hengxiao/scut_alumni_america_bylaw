## How the 10 Reference Organizations Handle Committees

### Overview

Committees are how nonprofits distribute work, develop leaders, and deepen member engagement beyond the Board. The 10 reference organizations range from no committee structure (XTUAANA — the current SCUT model) to highly structured committee frameworks with 5–6 named standing committees.

| Organization | Committee Structure | Named Standing Committees |
|---|---|---|
| PUAASC | 5 named standing committees | Events, Membership, Finance, Scholarship, Communications |
| PKUAA-NE | Board may establish committees | None specified |
| USTCAF | 6 named standing committees | Events, Membership, Academic Affairs, Professional Dev, Finance, Public Relations |
| FDAAGLA | General committee provision | None named |
| XTUAANA | **None** | None (critical gap) |
| CTUAAA | Not detailed | Not specified |
| SJTU-SV | 5 named standing committees | Events, Membership, Finance, Student Career Dev, Outreach |
| HCSSA | 6 named standing committees | Events, Academic, Career/Prof Dev, Cultural Arts, Community Service, Communications |
| TAAGNY | 6 named standing committees | Events, Membership, Finance, Young Alumni/Student, Tech/Industry Networking, NAFTHAA Liaison |
| OCA | National committees + chapter system | Convention-established committees |

## Model 1: No Formal Committee Structure

**Organizations:** XTUAANA (also reflects SCUT Alumni America's current state)

**Description:** All organizational functions are handled directly by the officers. No committees exist in the bylaws or organizational structure.

**Pros:**
- Simplest structure; no committee chair recruitment burden
- Appropriate for very small organizations (fewer than 30 active members)
- Reduces organizational complexity during early stages

**Cons:**
- All work falls on the President and a few officers; burnout risk is high
- No pathway to develop new leaders from within the membership
- Organizational capacity is capped by the officers' personal capacity
- New members have no role other than attending events — low engagement
- Institutional knowledge is concentrated among officers; turnover is disruptive

**XTUAANA Analysis Finding:**
> "No committee structure exists. All organizational activities are run directly by the officers. This limits organizational capacity and member engagement."

---

## Model 2: General Committee Authorization (No Named Committees)

**Organizations:** PKUAA-NE, FDAAGLA

**Description:** The bylaws authorize the Board to establish committees as needed, but do not name specific standing committees. This gives maximum flexibility but provides no structure.

**PKUAA-NE Language:**
> "The Board may establish standing and special committees and define their charters, composition, and authority."

**Pros:**
- Flexible — the Board can create committees to match actual organizational needs
- Does not lock the organization into a committee structure that may not be needed
- Reduces the risk of having "zombie committees" that exist in the bylaws but are never active

**Cons:**
- Without named committees, the Board may never get around to creating them
- Signals that committees are an afterthought rather than a core organizational structure
- Members who want to get involved do not have an obvious pathway

---

## Model 3: Named Standing Committees (5–6 Committees)

**Organizations:** PUAASC, SJTU-SV, HCSSA, TAAGNY, USTCAF

**Description:** The bylaws name specific standing committees, define their general mandate, and establish that committee chairs are appointed by the President (usually with Board approval). Additional committees may be created as needed.

### Committee Types Across Organizations

**Events / Activities Committee** (appears in: PUAASC, SJTU-SV, HCSSA, TAAGNY, USTCAF)
> Plans and organizes social events, cultural celebrations, annual banquet, holiday events, community gatherings.

**Why essential:** Events are the primary member touchpoint for most alumni associations. A dedicated Events Committee ensures event quality and relieves the President of operational coordination.

---

**Membership Committee** (appears in: PUAASC, SJTU-SV, TAAGNY, USTCAF)
> Manages member recruitment, dues collection, membership record-keeping, and member services.

**Why important:** Membership growth and retention are existential for any alumni association. A dedicated Membership Committee creates accountability for growing the member base.

---

**Finance / Financial Review Committee** (appears in: PUAASC, SJTU-SV, TAAGNY, USTCAF)
> Reviews annual budget, recommends financial policies, provides internal oversight of accounts; distinct from the Treasurer (who manages finances) by providing independent review.

**Governance Note:** The Finance Committee (oversight) is distinct from the Treasurer (operations). Having a Finance Committee provides an independent check on the Treasurer's work, which is a best practice for financial accountability.

---

**Communications / PR Committee** (appears in: PUAASC, HCSSA, USTCAF)
> Manages website, social media (WeChat, LinkedIn), newsletter, event publicity, media relations.

**Why important:** For Chinese alumni associations, communications — especially WeChat group management — is a significant ongoing workload. A Communications Committee ensures consistent messaging and digital presence.

---

**Academic / Professional Development Committee** (appears in: HCSSA, SJTU-SV, USTCAF, TAAGNY)
> Organizes career fairs, networking events, mentorship programs, academic lectures; supports member professional development.

**SJTU-SV "Student Career Development" Committee:**
> Organizes internship and job search support for SJTU students in the Bay Area; mentorship from SJTU alumni to students.

**Why important:** Professional networking and career development are consistently cited as primary reasons alumni join and remain active in alumni associations. This committee delivers direct member value.

---

**Young Alumni / New Arrival Committee** (appears in: TAAGNY, HCSSA as implicit)
> Organizes programs for recently graduated alumni and newly arrived SCUT alumni in the US; manages mentorship programs connecting newcomers with established alumni.

**TAAGNY Most Explicit:**
> "Young Alumni and Student Committee: Organizes programs for recent graduates and students; manages mentorship programs."

**Why especially important for SCUT Alumni America:** Supporting newly arrived SCUT alumni (graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, new employees) is already a de facto core activity of SCUT Alumni America. Naming a dedicated committee formalizes this commitment and provides a home for volunteers who want to support newcomers.

---

**Scholarship / Education Committee** (appears in: PUAASC, USTCAF implicitly)
> Manages scholarship programs, award nominations, fundraising for educational purposes.

**PUAASC:**
> Scholarship Committee: Manages scholarship fund, solicits applications, selects recipients.

**Why important:** If SCUT Alumni America operates any scholarship funds or wants to, a Scholarship Committee provides structure for fair selection processes.

---

**NAFTHAA / Federation Liaison Committee** (appears in: TAAGNY only)
> Coordinates the organization's participation in the North America Federation of Tsinghua Alumni Associations. This is specific to TAAGNY's federated context.

**Relevance to SCUT:** If SCUT Alumni America coordinates with other SCUT alumni groups (China chapters, other US city chapters), a Liaison Committee role is appropriate.

---

## Model 4: Committee Chairs as Part of the Governing Board (HCSSA Model)

**Organization:** HCSSA only

**Description:** Committee chairs are formally part of the Executive Board — they sit alongside the President, Vice Presidents, Secretary, and Treasurer as Board members.

**HCSSA Structure:**
> Executive Board = President + Vice Presidents + Secretary + Treasurer + Committee Chairs
> Committee Chairs are appointed by the President in consultation with VPs.
> No person may chair more than one committee simultaneously.

**Pros:**
- Integrates committee leadership directly into governance
- Ensures committee chairs have information access equal to officers
- Committee work is treated as governance-level, not administrative-level
- Creates a clear leadership pathway: member → committee volunteer → committee chair → officer

**Cons:**
- Executive Board can become very large (8–12 persons with multiple committee chairs)
- Chairs who are underperforming must be removed via Board process rather than simply replaced
- Creates ambiguity: are committee chairs Board members with fiduciary duties, or are they operational leads?
- Works best for student organizations; may not translate well to alumni associations

---

## Committee Governance: How Chairs Are Appointed

| Organization | Chair Appointment Process |
|---|---|
| PUAASC | President appoints with Board approval |
| SJTU-SV | President appoints with Board approval |
| TAAGNY | President appoints with Board approval |
| OCA | President appoints with Board approval |
| HCSSA | President appoints in consultation with VPs (but chairs are Board members) |
| USTCAF | General Board appoints on EC recommendation |

**Universal Standard:** President nominates committee chairs; Board (or a Board committee) approves. This is appropriate and should be SCUT Alumni America's model.

**Best Practice Addition (HCSSA):**
> "No person shall serve as Chair of more than one (1) committee simultaneously." — Prevents one person from dominating the committee structure.

---

## Committee Membership and Volunteers

Most organizations explicitly welcome non-Board members as committee volunteers:

**SJTU-SV:**
> "All members in good standing are eligible to serve on committees."

**HCSSA:**
> "Additional volunteers are welcome to join any committee. Committee volunteers shall not be recognized as official HCSSA officers but their contributions shall be acknowledged."

**Why This Matters:** Committees are the primary way to engage members who are interested in contributing but not ready for Board or officer roles. A well-functioning committee structure can engage 20–30 active members beyond the 9–15 Directors.

## Recommended Committee Structure for SCUT Alumni America

Based on the consensus across mature peer organizations, and aligned with SCUT Alumni America's stated activities:

| Committee | Mandate |
|---|---|
| **Events Committee** | Plans annual banquet, Spring Festival celebration, summer picnic, holiday events, and other social gatherings |
| **Membership and Outreach Committee** | Manages member recruitment, dues collection, membership records, and welcome programs for new members |
| **Communications Committee** | Manages WeChat groups, website, social media, newsletter, and publicity for all events |
| **Professional Development Committee** | Organizes career networking events, industry talks, mentorship programs, and job search support |
| **Young Alumni and New Arrivals Committee** | Supports newly arrived SCUT alumni and students; runs orientation programs, peer mentoring, and newcomer networking |
| **Finance Committee** | Reviews financial reports, recommends financial policies, provides internal oversight independent of the Treasurer |

This structure of 6 standing committees matches HCSSA and TAAGNY's approach and comprehensively covers SCUT Alumni America's actual activities.

## Recommendations for SCUT Alumni America

### Critical

1. **Establish a formal committee structure in the bylaws.** The current absence of any committee structure (matching the XTUAANA gap) is the most significant organizational capacity limitation. Committees distribute workload, develop leaders, and deepen member engagement.

2. **Name at least 5 standing committees in the bylaws.** Based on peer practice: Events, Membership/Outreach, Communications, Professional Development, and Young Alumni/New Arrivals. A Finance Committee is also recommended.

### High Priority

3. **Specify committee chair appointment process.** President nominates, Board approves. One person may not chair more than one committee simultaneously (HCSSA best practice).

4. **Explicitly allow all members in good standing to serve on committees** (not just Directors or officers).

### Medium Priority

5. **Allow the Board to establish ad hoc special committees** for time-limited needs (e.g., a Bylaw Revision Committee, a Special Events Planning Committee for a reunion).

6. **Consider whether a Scholarship Committee is appropriate**, if SCUT Alumni America operates or plans to operate any scholarship fund.

7. **Consider a SCUT University Liaison Committee** to manage the ongoing relationship with SCUT's Alumni Affairs Office and facilitate communication between the US alumni community and the university.
