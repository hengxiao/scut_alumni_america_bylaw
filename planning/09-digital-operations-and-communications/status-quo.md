# Status Quo: Digital Operations and Communications

## What the Current By-Laws Say

The current By-Laws contain no article or section on digital operations or communications.

**Only mentions of digital channels:**
- Article IV §4: Notice may be given "in the form of electronic mail."
- Article V §4(e): Board meeting summaries shall be accessible to members "either posted on the organization web site or other means."

## Gaps and Observations

- No official communication channels are defined beyond email.
- No rules for who controls the organization's website, domain, or social media accounts.
- No handoff process when officers change — departing officers may retain access to organizational accounts.
- No distinction between official organizational communications and personal statements made by officers.
- No member data privacy or security provisions.
- No rules for digital record-keeping or cloud storage of organizational documents.
- The organization's actual day-to-day communication (likely via WeChat groups, email lists, or similar) is entirely unaddressed.
- No mention of electronic voting systems, online meeting platforms, or other tools in common use.
