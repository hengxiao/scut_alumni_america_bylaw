# Policy Questions: Digital Operations and Communications

These are the questions the organization must answer before drafting the digital operations and communications provisions of the revised By-Laws. Each question reflects a real policy choice rather than a legal requirement.

## 1. What are the organization's official communication channels?

The organization communicates through some combination of email, WeChat, a website, and possibly other platforms, but none of this is defined in the governing documents.
- Which channels are designated as "official" for notices, announcements, and decisions?
- Is a WeChat group (or multiple WeChat groups) an official channel, and if so, which one — and who controls it?
- Should the organization have a single canonical mailing list to which all members are subscribed, and who maintains it?
- When a message is sent on an official channel by an officer, does it carry the weight of an organizational communication, or is it just personal opinion unless specifically labeled otherwise?

## 2. Who owns and controls the organization's digital assets?

The organization likely has a domain name, website, email addresses, social media accounts, and possibly cloud storage. There are no rules for who controls these.
- Should ownership of these accounts vest in the organization (rather than any individual officer), with all credentials stored in a shared organizational password manager?
- Who is the primary responsible party for the website — the Secretary, a designated Webmaster, or a Digital Operations Officer?
- Should the By-Laws require that at least two officers have admin access to each official digital asset at all times, so that no single departure can lock the organization out?

## 3. How are credentials and account access handed off when officers change?

When an officer leaves their role, they may currently retain access to organizational accounts they set up personally.
- Should there be a formal credential handoff requirement as part of the officer transition process — with a deadline (e.g., within 14 days of a successor taking office)?
- Should the organization maintain a centralized inventory of all accounts, passwords, and access credentials that is accessible to the Board?
- What happens if a departing officer refuses to hand over access? Who has the authority to initiate account recovery, and how should the By-Laws empower that person?

## 4. How should member data be collected, stored, and protected?

The membership roll contains personal information (names, email addresses, phone numbers, potentially mailing addresses and SCUT alumni details). There are no data protection rules.
- Should the organization adopt a privacy policy governing how member data is used?
- Should member data be stored in a defined system (e.g., a Google Sheet, an official membership management platform), rather than in an individual officer's personal files?
- Should there be restrictions on who within the organization can access the full membership roll?
- Should the organization's members be informed of what data is collected about them, how it is stored, and how long it is retained?
- Should the organization comply with any applicable data protection laws (e.g., California Consumer Privacy Act) and should the By-Laws acknowledge this obligation?

## 5. What digital tools may be used for voting?

Electronic voting is referenced in the By-Laws but completely undefined. The organization should decide:
- Which specific platforms or tools are approved for conducting member votes or Board votes (e.g., a Google Form, a dedicated voting service, a built-in poll in the meeting platform)?
- What authentication mechanism ensures that only eligible members can cast a vote?
- How is the integrity of an electronic vote maintained — can votes be changed after submission, and who can view individual responses?
- Should electronic votes be archived for a minimum period as part of the official record of organizational decisions?

---

## 6. What constitutes an "official" organizational communication vs. a personal statement?

Officers and directors may speak publicly (on social media, in interviews, at community events) in ways that others perceive as representing the organization.
- Should the By-Laws state that only communications explicitly issued in the officer's official capacity or on an official organizational channel constitute organizational positions?
- Should there be a disclaimer requirement — e.g., officers must clarify when posting on personal social media that views are their own?
- Should there be a policy on who has the authority to issue press releases, public statements, or official positions on behalf of the organization?

---

## 7. How should digital records be maintained and archived?

The organization generates records digitally — meeting minutes, financial reports, membership rolls, correspondence — but there are no rules for how these are stored or for how long.
- Should the organization maintain a central digital archive (e.g., a shared Google Drive folder) accessible to all Board members?
- Should the archive be organized by year, by document type, or both?
- Should there be a record retention schedule specifying how long different types of documents must be kept before they can be deleted?
- Who is responsible for maintaining the archive and ensuring records from previous officers are transferred in and not lost?
- Should critical records (By-Laws, incorporation documents, tax filings) be stored in at least two independent locations (e.g., cloud plus a local backup) to prevent loss?
