# Status Quo: Leadership / Executive Election and Appointment Process

## What the Current By-Laws Say

**Article V — Board of Directors**

- **Nomination (§6):** Any member may be nominated by a method authorized by the Board or by law. No specific nomination process is defined.
- **Election (§7):** Directors are elected by members. Each member submits up to 21 votes. Candidates chosen by a majority of voting members are elected. If fewer than the minimum (11) are elected this way, the top vote-getters fill remaining seats. If candidates exceed the maximum (21), a lottery decides among those tied for the last seat. Voting "can be held electronically" — no further rules given.
- **Term (§5):** Three years, or until a successor is elected.
- **Vacancies (§8):** A director may resign in writing. A director absent from three consecutive meetings is considered resigned. If the board falls below the minimum, temporary directors must be elected within six months by the remaining board.

**Article VI — Executive Officers**

- **Chairman (§2):** Elected by the Board. Majority vote required; if no majority, top two advance to runoff; tie broken by lottery. May be removed before term ends if they resign or if one-third of board members petition for re-election. Re-elected Chairman serves the remainder of the original term.
- **Vice Chairmen (§3):** Same election and removal process as Chairman.
- **Secretary (§4):** Appointed by the Board. Three-year term.
- **Treasurer (§5):** Appointed by the Board. Three-year term.

## Gaps and Observations

- Electronic voting has no rules: no authentication, no platform, no voting period, no results process.
- No nomination deadline or candidate vetting process defined.
- No definition of what constitutes an "excused" absence for the automatic-resignation rule.
- No notification process before a director is deemed automatically resigned.
- The 10% member petition threshold for By-Law amendments (Art. VIII) cannot be calculated without a defined membership roll.
- No provision for recalling a Secretary or Treasurer.
- No staggered terms — the entire board turns over at once, risking loss of institutional knowledge.
