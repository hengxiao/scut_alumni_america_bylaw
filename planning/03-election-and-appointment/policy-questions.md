# Policy Questions: Election and Appointment

These are the questions the organization must answer before drafting the election and appointment article of the revised By-Laws. Each question reflects a real policy choice rather than a legal requirement.

## 1. How should the nomination process work?

The current By-Laws say any member may be nominated "by a method authorized by the Board or by law" — effectively leaving the process undefined. The organization should decide:
- Is self-nomination allowed, or must candidates be nominated by other members?
- Should a nominating committee review candidates before they are placed on the ballot?
- Should candidates be required to submit a written statement of intent, a short biography, or a summary of what they plan to contribute?
- Is there a minimum period of membership required before a person can run for the Board or for an officer position?
- How far in advance of the election must nominations be submitted, and who receives them?

## 2. How should electronic voting work?

The current By-Laws say voting "can be held electronically" with no further rules. Before adopting electronic voting, the organization should decide:
- Which platform(s) are approved for electronic voting (e.g., a dedicated voting tool, a Google Form, a WeChat poll, email ballot)?
- How do we verify that only eligible members vote, and that each member votes only once?
- How long is the voting window open?
- Who administers the vote, counts the results, and certifies the outcome?
- Are results announced publicly, and if so, are vote totals disclosed or only the winners?
- Is electronic voting the default, or is in-person voting at the annual meeting the default with electronic as an alternative?

## 3. Should board terms be staggered?

Under the current By-Laws, all directors serve the same three-year term, meaning the entire board can be replaced at once. This creates a risk of total loss of institutional knowledge.
- Should the board be divided into cohorts with elections held in different years (e.g., elect one-third of the board each year)?
- How would staggered terms be introduced for the first time — should a lottery determine which sitting directors finish shortened terms?
- Does the organization have enough interested and eligible candidates to sustain staggered elections?

## 4. What counts as an "excused" absence that does not trigger automatic resignation?

Under the current By-Laws, a director is automatically considered resigned after three consecutive absences. But there is no definition of what makes an absence excused.
- Should absences be excused for medical reasons, work travel, family emergencies, or other circumstances?
- Who decides whether an absence is excused — the Chairman, the full Board, or a committee?
- Should there be a notification requirement — i.e., must a director inform the Secretary in advance to have an absence excused?
- Should the threshold differ for regular board meetings vs. special meetings?

## 5. How should the removal or recall process work for elected officers?

The current By-Laws allow the Chairman and Vice Chairmen to be removed by a petition from one-third of board members triggering a re-election, but there is no recall process for the Secretary, Treasurer, or individual directors.
- Should all elected officers be subject to the same removal process?
- Should there be a higher threshold for removal — e.g., a two-thirds vote of the full Board — to protect officers from purely political removal attempts?
- Should there be a "for cause" requirement (e.g., misconduct, dereliction of duty) as distinct from a "no-confidence" vote that requires no specific justification?
- Should the membership (not just the Board) have the power to recall officers?

---

## 6. How should mid-term vacancies be filled?

The current By-Laws address vacancies for directors (temporary replacement by board vote within six months) but not for officers.
- If the President/Chairman vacates mid-term, does the senior Vice President automatically assume the role, or must there be a new election?
- If an appointed officer (Secretary, Treasurer) vacates, can the Board immediately appoint a replacement without a waiting period?
- Should a mid-term replacement serve only the remainder of the original term, or start a fresh full term?

---

## 7. Should there be a transition or handoff period between outgoing and incoming leadership?

There is no provision in the current By-Laws for a structured handover when leadership changes.
- Should outgoing officers be required to serve alongside their successors for a defined period (e.g., one month) to facilitate knowledge transfer?
- Should there be a formal requirement to hand over all organizational assets (bank account access, digital accounts, records) within a set number of days after a new officer takes office?
- Who enforces this requirement if an outgoing officer does not cooperate?

---

## 8. Should there be any eligibility requirements for officer positions beyond Board membership?

Currently any board member can hold any officer position. The organization should decide:
- Should the Treasurer be required to have financial experience or professional qualifications?
- Should any officer have a minimum tenure as a board member before being eligible?
- Should officers be required to be in good standing (dues paid, no disciplinary history)?
- Should there be residency or geographic proximity requirements for any officer role (e.g., should the Secretary need to be in the same metro area as the organization's principal office)?
