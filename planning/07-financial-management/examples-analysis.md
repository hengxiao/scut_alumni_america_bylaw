## How the 10 Reference Organizations Handle Financial Management

### Overview of Key Dimensions

| Dimension | Range Across Examples |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Dual-signature threshold | $200 (SJTU-SV) to $500 (PKUAA-NE, TAAGNY) to not specified |
| Annual audit/review | Mandatory (OCA) to discretionary (TAAGNY) to not mentioned (most) |
| Budget approval | Board-approved annual budget (most organizations) |
| Fiscal year | December 31 (TAAGNY, OCA, SJTU-SV) to not specified |
| Financial reporting | Annual report to members (most) + quarterly to Board (some) |
| Treasurer role | Dedicated officer across all organizations |
| Reserve fund | Not mentioned in any bylaw (a gap across all examples) |

---

## Dimension 1: Dual-Signature Controls on Disbursements

The most universal financial control across all organizations is requiring two authorized officer signatures for disbursements above a threshold.

| Organization | Two-Signature Threshold | Signers |
|---|---|---|
| PKUAA-NE | $500 | Treasurer + one other officer |
| TAAGNY | $500 | Two authorized officers |
| SJTU-SV | $200 | Treasurer + President |
| PUAASC | Not specified threshold | Treasurer + one officer |
| FDAAGLA | Dual signature required | Officers (threshold not specified) |
| OCA | Board-set threshold | Treasurer + co-signer |
| USTCAF | Not specified | Executive Committee authorized |
| XTUAANA | Not specified | Not addressed |

**Analysis:**

The $500 threshold (PKUAA-NE, TAAGNY) is the most common specific amount. SJTU-SV's $200 is more conservative. The threshold should be calibrated to the organization's transaction volume — too low means constant dual-signature burdens for routine expenses; too high means single-officer control over significant funds.

**Pros of Dual-Signature Controls:**
- Prevents unilateral misappropriation or error by a single officer
- Creates a second review point for significant expenditures
- Standard financial control for all nonprofit organizations
- Reassures members about fiscal responsibility

**Cons/Limitations:**
- Administrative inconvenience for routine small expenses below the threshold
- If both signers are unavailable simultaneously, payments can be delayed
- Does not prevent collusion between two officers acting together

**TAAGNY Best Practice:**
> "All disbursements over an amount set by the Board (not less than $500) shall require the signatures of at least two (2) authorized officers."

Setting the threshold "not less than $500" but board-set provides flexibility to adjust upward as the organization grows while establishing a floor.

## Dimension 2: Annual Independent Financial Review / Audit

| Organization | Audit/Review Requirement |
|---|---|
| OCA | **Mandatory annual CPA audit** required by bylaws |
| TAAGNY | "Board **may** engage CPA for annual financial statement review" (discretionary) |
| PKUAA-NE | Not specified |
| SJTU-SV | Not specified |
| PUAASC | Not specified |
| FDAAGLA | Not specified |
| XTUAANA | Not specified |
| USTCAF | Not specified (but 501(c)(3) IRS reporting requires financial discipline) |

**Key Distinction:** OCA mandates an annual CPA audit; TAAGNY makes it discretionary; most other organizations are silent.

**California Law Context:**
- California Nonprofit Integrity Act requires organizations with gross revenues over **$2 million** to have annual audits
- Organizations with revenues between **$1 million and $2 million** must have annual reviews (less rigorous than full audit)
- Below $1 million: no mandatory audit/review under state law

**Analysis:**

For SCUT Alumni America at its current size (likely under $200K annual revenue), a mandatory audit is not legally required and may be disproportionately expensive ($3,000–$8,000 per year for a full CPA audit). However, authorizing the Board to engage a CPA for a periodic review (every 2–3 years, or when revenues exceed a threshold) is prudent governance.

**TAAGNY Model (Recommended for Current Stage):**
> "The Board may engage an independent certified public accountant to conduct an annual review of the Association's financial statements."

**OCA Model (Appropriate as Organization Grows):**
> "OCA National shall engage an independent certified public accountant to conduct an annual audit of the organization's financial statements."

## Dimension 3: Budget Approval and Financial Reporting

| Organization | Budget Process | Financial Reporting |
|---|---|---|
| PKUAA-NE | Board approves annual budget | Treasurer reports quarterly to Board; annual to members |
| TAAGNY | Board approves annual budget | Treasurer presents annual report to Board and to members |
| OCA | Board approves annual operating budget | Treasurer reports at each Board meeting + annual Convention report |
| SJTU-SV | Board approves annual budget | Treasurer presents financial reports |
| PUAASC | Board approves budget | Annual financial report to members |
| FDAAGLA | Board-managed | Annual report at member meeting |

**Consensus Model (Used by Most Organizations):**
1. Treasurer drafts annual budget before each fiscal year
2. Board reviews and approves the budget
3. Treasurer presents financial updates at each Board meeting (quarterly or more frequently)
4. Treasurer presents comprehensive annual financial report at the member meeting
5. All expenditures must fall within the approved budget; significant overages require Board approval

**OCA's Two-Level Reporting Model:**
> "The Treasurer shall present a financial report at each Board meeting and a comprehensive annual report at the National Convention."

This two-level model — Board updates + annual member report — ensures both governance (Board) and accountability (members) are served.

## Dimension 4: Fiscal Year

| Organization | Fiscal Year End |
|---|---|
| TAAGNY | December 31 |
| OCA | December 31 |
| SJTU-SV | December 31 (likely — matches IRS standard) |
| PUAASC | Not specified |
| PKUAA-NE | Not specified |
| XTUAANA | Not specified |

**Analysis:** December 31 (calendar year) is the standard for most nonprofits and simplifies IRS Form 990 filing. Some organizations use June 30 or March 31 fiscal years to align with grant cycles or academic calendars. For SCUT Alumni America, December 31 is most appropriate — it aligns with the US calendar year, Chinese New Year planning cycles, and avoids overlap with summer events.

**Recommendation:** Specify December 31 as the fiscal year end in the bylaws.

## Dimension 5: Financial Institution and Account Management

| Organization | Account Provisions |
|---|---|
| OCA | "All funds held in accounts in the name of OCA in one or more federally insured financial institutions" |
| TAAGNY | "All funds held in accounts in the name of TAAGNY at one or more federally insured financial institutions" |
| PKUAA-NE | Treasurer authorized to establish bank accounts in organization's name |
| SJTU-SV | Standard banking provisions |

**Best Practice Language (OCA/TAAGNY):**
> "All funds of the Association shall be held in accounts in the name of [Organization] in one or more federally insured financial institutions."

This language:
- Requires accounts to be in the organization's name (not a personal account)
- Requires federally insured institutions (FDIC-insured banks)
- Allows multiple accounts (checking, savings, etc.)

## Dimension 6: Treasurer's Role and Responsibilities

Across all 10 organizations, the Treasurer's core responsibilities are essentially identical:

**Universal Treasurer Duties:**
1. Maintain financial records and books of account
2. Receive and deposit all funds into organization accounts
3. Co-sign checks/disbursements above the threshold
4. Prepare and present financial reports (Board + annual member meeting)
5. Prepare or oversee preparation of tax returns (IRS Form 990 or 990-EZ)
6. Prepare proposed annual budget for Board approval

**TAAGNY Additional Duty:** "Oversee banking and financial transactions" — broader oversight role, not just co-signing.

**OCA Additional Duty:** "Co-sign financial transactions above a threshold set by the Board" — the threshold is Board-set, not hardcoded.

**Recommendation:** Specify Treasurer duties in the bylaws rather than leaving them undefined. The Treasurer role is the most consequential financial governance position in the organization.

---

## Dimension 7: Investment and Reserve Fund Policy

**Gap across all organizations:** None of the 10 reference organizations' bylaws address investment policy, reserve funds, or endowments in detail. This is common for small nonprofits.

**However:**
- USTCAF (a foundation) implicitly has an endowment management framework
- OCA and TAAGNY have sufficient revenues to warrant reserve fund policies, but these are handled in Board-adopted policies (not bylaws)

**Recommendation for SCUT Alumni America:** If the organization maintains any accumulated reserves or scholarship funds, the bylaws should at minimum authorize the Board to adopt an investment policy. Actual investment decisions should be in the Board-adopted policy, not the bylaws.

## Recommendations for SCUT Alumni America

### Critical

1. **Add a dual-signature disbursement control.** Set the threshold at $500 (matching the most common peer organization standard). Any disbursement over $500 requires sign-off from Treasurer plus one other officer (President or designated VP).

2. **Specify the fiscal year as December 31.** This aligns with standard US nonprofit practice and simplifies tax reporting.

3. **Require Board-approved annual budget.** The Board should approve the operating budget before the start of each fiscal year. Unbudgeted expenditures above a threshold (e.g., $1,000) should require Board approval.

### High Priority

4. **Establish two-level financial reporting.** Treasurer reports financials at each Board meeting (quarterly at minimum); presents comprehensive annual report to members at the annual meeting.

5. **Authorize the Board to engage a CPA for periodic financial review.** Not mandatory at current size, but the authorization should be in the bylaws so the Board can act when appropriate (e.g., when revenues exceed $50,000 annually).

6. **Require organization-named bank accounts.** Explicitly prohibit holding organizational funds in personal accounts.

### Medium Priority

7. **Define Treasurer responsibilities in the bylaws.** Specify the duties listed above as standard best practices.

8. **Authorize the Board to adopt an investment and reserve fund policy.** Even if the organization has no reserves now, this authorization positions the organization to manage reserves properly when they accumulate.
