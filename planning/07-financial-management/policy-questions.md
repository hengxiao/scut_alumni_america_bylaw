# Policy Questions: Financial Management

These are the questions the organization must answer before drafting the financial management article of the revised By-Laws. Each question reflects a real policy choice rather than a legal requirement.

## 1. What are the expenditure approval thresholds?

The current By-Laws require two-signature authorization for withdrawals but set no dollar thresholds for what the Treasurer can spend autonomously vs. what requires Board approval.
- Below what dollar amount may the Treasurer disburse funds without seeking Board approval (e.g., routine operational expenses under $200)?
- Above what dollar amount must a single expenditure receive full Board approval before being made?
- Should there be a middle tier — e.g., expenditures over $500 but under $2,000 may be approved by the President and Treasurer jointly, without convening the full Board?
- Should emergency expenditures (e.g., a last-minute venue deposit) follow a different process with after-the-fact Board ratification?

## 2. What is the annual budgeting process?

There is currently no budget process in the By-Laws. The organization should decide:
- Should an annual budget be prepared and approved by the Board before the start of each fiscal year?
- Who prepares the budget draft — the Treasurer alone, or the Treasurer in consultation with officers and committee chairs?
- Should the budget be presented to the membership for information or approval at the annual meeting?
- What happens if the organization receives an unexpected windfall (e.g., a large donation) or faces an unexpected shortfall mid-year — who has the authority to authorize an unbudgeted expenditure?

## 3. What modern payment methods should be authorized?

The current By-Laws were written with checks in mind (requiring "two signatures for withdrawal"), but much of the organization's financial activity likely happens through digital platforms.
- Which platforms are authorized for collecting member dues and event fees (e.g., PayPal, Zelle, Venmo, Square, Stripe)?
- Can the organization use a debit card, and if so, who holds it and what are the limits?
- Should the "two-signature" requirement be adapted for digital transactions — for example, requiring the President and Treasurer to both approve a PayPal transfer before it is sent?
- Should any platform that holds organizational funds require two administrators on the account?

## 4. Should there be an independent financial review or audit?

The current By-Laws do not require any external review of the organization's finances. Options include:
- **No formal review** — the Treasurer's annual report to the membership is sufficient
- **Internal review** — a small finance committee reviews the Treasurer's records annually and reports to the Board
- **External compilation or review** — a CPA prepares or reviews the financial statements
- **Full external audit** — required only once assets or revenues exceed a certain threshold

What is the appropriate level of oversight given the organization's current size, and at what revenue or asset level should the requirement escalate?

## 5. What financial records must be kept, and for how long?

There are no record retention rules in the current By-Laws. The organization should decide:
- What categories of financial records must be retained (bank statements, receipts, invoices, contracts, tax filings)?
- For how long must each category be kept — one year, three years, seven years (the IRS standard for business records)?
- In what format should records be kept — physical copies, digital scans, cloud storage?
- Who is responsible for maintaining and organizing records, and what happens to records when the Treasurer changes?

---

## 6. How should member dues and event fee collections be handled and recorded?

The current By-Laws do not address the mechanics of collecting money from members.
- Should each payment (dues or event registration) be acknowledged with a receipt?
- Should the membership roll track dues payment status alongside contact information?
- Should event fees be kept in a separate event account or pooled with general funds?
- What happens to event fees if an event is cancelled — are they refunded, applied to a future event, or retained in the general fund?

---

## 7. How should the Treasurer's annual financial report be structured?

The only financial reporting requirement in the current By-Laws is that the Treasurer "submit an annual account of the organization," with no format specified.
- Should the annual report include a balance sheet (assets and liabilities), an income statement (revenues and expenses), and a comparison to the annual budget?
- Should the report be presented at the annual membership meeting and also made available to members who could not attend?
- Should the report be filed alongside the organization's IRS Form 990 submission?
- Is there a deadline by which the annual report must be ready (e.g., within 60 days of the fiscal year end)?

---

## 8. What is the organization's fiscal year?

The current By-Laws do not define a fiscal year.
- Should the fiscal year run January 1 to December 31 (calendar year), which aligns naturally with annual events and membership renewals?
- Or should it run on a different cycle (e.g., July 1 to June 30) that better matches the organization's event calendar?
- The fiscal year choice also affects IRS filing deadlines (Form 990 is due 5.5 months after fiscal year end).

---

## 9. What happens to the organization's finances when the Treasurer vacates mid-term?

There is no succession plan for the Treasurer role.
- Should the President immediately assume signatory authority on bank accounts until a new Treasurer is appointed?
- Should a formal handoff checklist exist that the outgoing Treasurer must complete within a set number of days?
- Should a second officer always be listed as a backup signatory on financial accounts to avoid being locked out of funds during a transition?
