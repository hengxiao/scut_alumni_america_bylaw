# Status Quo: Financial Management

## What the Current By-Laws Say

**Article VII — Organization Fund**
The entire article consists of one paragraph:

> The organization fund shall be deposited in a federal insured finance institution under the name of South China University of Technology Alumni, America. Signatures of officers shall be on the account. Two signatures are required for withdrawal.

**Article VI §5 — Treasurer duties:**
- Collect donations and assessments; keep account of assets and liabilities.
- Keep account of all financial transactions.
- Co-sign checks; disburse funds for Board-approved obligations.
- Submit an annual account of the organization.
- Hold custody of all bank books.

## Gaps and Observations

- No budgeting process defined.
- No expenditure approval thresholds — it is unclear what the Board must pre-approve vs. what the Treasurer can act on independently.
- No provision for online payment platforms (dues collected via PayPal, Zelle, etc.), which may not support dual-signature workflows.
- No requirement for an independent financial review or audit.
- "Annual account" is the only financial reporting requirement, with no format or content specified.
- No record retention period specified for financial documents.
- No process defined if the Treasurer is unavailable or vacates mid-term.
- No prohibition on co-mingling personal and organizational funds.
