# Status Quo: Conflict of Interest

## What the Current By-Laws Say

The current By-Laws contain no conflict of interest provisions.

**Closest relevant language:**
- Article III §2: No part of assets shall inure to the benefit of any member, and no member shall be compensated except for board-approved expenses. This prevents direct financial self-dealing but does not address the broader category of conflicts of interest.

## Gaps and Observations

- No definition of what constitutes a conflict of interest.
- No disclosure requirement for directors or officers who have a personal interest in a matter before the Board.
- No recusal or abstention rules.
- No process for the Board to evaluate and resolve a disclosed conflict.
- No recordkeeping requirement for conflicts and how they were handled.
- California law (Corp. Code §7233) imposes rules on self-dealing transactions for directors of nonprofit mutual benefit corporations. The current By-Laws do not address this.
