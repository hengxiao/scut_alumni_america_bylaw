## How the 10 Reference Organizations Handle Conflict of Interest

### Overview

Conflict of interest (COI) governance is one of the areas where the sample organizations show the widest variance — from comprehensive bylaws provisions (501(c)(3) organizations) to complete absence (most 501(c)(7) organizations).

| Organization | COI in Bylaws | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| PUAASC | Referenced — separate policy | Brief reference; full policy in separate document |
| PKUAA-NE | **In bylaws** | Standard disclosure + recusal provision |
| USTCAF | **In articles/bylaws** | 501(c)(3) requirement; immutable core article |
| FDAAGLA | Minimal | Not explicitly addressed |
| XTUAANA | **Missing** | Not addressed |
| CTUAAA | Not specified | Not addressed |
| SJTU-SV | **In bylaws** | Standard COI provision |
| HCSSA | Referenced indirectly | Harvard policies govern |
| TAAGNY | **In bylaws** | Standard disclosure + recusal |
| OCA | **In bylaws** | Non-partisan clause + implicit COI |

## Why Conflict of Interest Matters

**Conflicts of interest arise in nonprofit organizations when:**
- A Director is also a vendor to the organization (e.g., a photographer Director who is paid for event photography)
- A Director's employer has a business relationship with the organization (e.g., sponsorship)
- A Director's family member is employed by or contracts with the organization
- A Director is negotiating for a personal benefit while making organizational decisions
- A Director has competing board memberships (e.g., on the board of a rival alumni association)

**Risks of Failing to Address COI:**
- Financial harm to the organization from self-dealing transactions
- Breach of the Directors' duty of loyalty under California law
- For 501(c)(3) organizations, potential IRS private benefit violations
- Reputational damage if self-dealing becomes known to members
- Loss of member trust and organizational legitimacy

**California Law Context:**
California Nonprofit Corporation Law (Corp. Code §7233) explicitly requires that certain "interested party" transactions (contracts in which a Director has a material financial interest) are only valid if:
1. The Director's interest was disclosed to the Board, AND
2. The Board authorized the transaction by a vote sufficient without counting the interested Director's vote

This is California law regardless of what the bylaws say — but having an explicit COI provision in the bylaws makes the requirement clear to all Directors.

## Model 1: Separate COI Policy (Referenced in Bylaws)

**Organizations:** PUAASC, most mature nonprofits

**Description:** The bylaws include a brief provision acknowledging that the organization will maintain a conflict of interest policy, and direct Directors to the policy document for specifics. The full policy is adopted by the Board as a separate document.

**Pros:**
- Clean separation: bylaws contain the governance framework; policies contain the operational details
- COI policy can be updated by Board resolution without a bylaw amendment
- Industry-standard IRS Form 990 Schedule O COI policy can be adopted directly
- Easier to make context-specific (e.g., define "material financial interest" for a small organization)

**Cons:**
- If the separate policy is never adopted, the bylaw provision is meaningless
- Members may not know the COI policy exists or have easy access to it
- Less legally robust than having COI rules directly in the bylaws

---

## Model 2: COI Provision Directly in Bylaws

**Organizations:** PKUAA-NE, SJTU-SV, TAAGNY

**Description:** The bylaws include a standalone COI article or section with the core requirements: disclosure obligation, recusal requirement, and documentation.

**SJTU-SV Model Provision (representative of this model):**
> "Any Director or officer who has a material financial interest in a proposed contract, transaction, or other matter being considered by the Board shall:
> (a) Disclose the nature and extent of the interest to the Board before the Board acts on the matter;
> (b) Recuse themselves from discussion and voting on the matter;
> (c) Leave the room during the Board's discussion and vote, if requested by a majority of the remaining Directors.
> The remaining disinterested Directors shall determine whether the transaction is fair and in the organization's best interest. The minutes shall record the disclosure, the recusal, and the vote of the disinterested Directors."

**Pros:**
- COI rules are binding as part of the bylaws (harder to ignore than a separate policy)
- All Directors are directly on notice of their obligations when they receive the bylaws
- California law explicitly authorizes and implicitly expects this kind of provision (Corp. Code §7233)
- Does not require a separate policy document to be operative

**Cons:**
- Detailed COI provisions make the bylaws longer and more complex
- Bylaw amendment required to update the COI rules as circumstances change
- May be over-engineered for a small volunteer organization with minimal self-dealing risk

---

## Model 3: COI as an Immutable Core Article (USTCAF)

**Organizations:** USTCAF only

**Description:** USTCAF's articles include a COI provision as one of the protected "core articles" that cannot be amended without heightened procedural requirements (2/3 vote + 30-day notice + cooling-off period).

**Why USTCAF Does This:**
As a 501(c)(3) organization, USTCAF's tax-exempt status depends on ensuring that no private benefit occurs. Making COI an immutable core article signals to the IRS and members that self-dealing is a fundamental governance breach, not merely a procedural matter.

**Relevance to SCUT Alumni America:** As a 501(c)(7) (not 501(c)(3)), SCUT Alumni America does not face the same IRS private benefit standard. However, the principle — that COI rules should be harder to change than routine bylaws provisions — has merit.

---

## Model 4: Minimal/No COI Provision

**Organizations:** FDAAGLA, XTUAANA, CTUAAA

**Description:** No explicit conflict of interest provision in the bylaws. Relies on the good judgment of Directors and, for California organizations, the default protections of California Corp. Code §7233.

**Pros:**
- Simplest — no additional governance burden
- For a small, trust-based community organization, formal COI rules may seem overly legalistic
- California law provides some default protections regardless

**Cons:**
- Directors may not know they have disclosure obligations under California law
- No mechanism for the organization to enforce COI expectations
- Creates risk of self-dealing transactions being later challenged
- Not best practice for any organization with significant financial transactions

## IRS Form 990 and COI Policy

**IRS Form 990 Schedule O** asks nonprofits: "Did the organization have a written conflict of interest policy?" and "Were officers, directors, or trustees, and key employees required to disclose annually interests that could give rise to conflicts?"

- For **501(c)(3)** organizations: A COI policy is effectively required (answers of "No" to 990 questions are highly scrutinized)
- For **501(c)(7)** organizations: COI policy is not legally required but is still considered best governance practice
- SCUT Alumni America files **Form 990-EZ or 990-N** (depending on size); a COI policy strengthens the organization's governance posture

## Elements of a Complete COI Policy/Provision

Based on IRS recommendations (Publication 557) and peer organization practices, a complete COI provision for SCUT Alumni America should include:

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| **Scope** | Applies to Directors, officers, and committee chairs |
| **Definition of "conflict"** | Material financial interest in a transaction; competing board memberships; family relationships with vendors |
| **Disclosure obligation** | Must disclose before the Board considers the relevant matter |
| **Recusal obligation** | Must abstain from discussion and vote |
| **Disinterested Director determination** | Remaining Directors must determine transaction is fair and in the organization's best interest |
| **Documentation** | Minutes must record the disclosure, the recusal, and the disinterested vote |
| **Annual disclosure** | Directors complete an annual disclosure form listing known interests |
| **Enforcement** | Failure to disclose may result in removal from the Board |

---

## Annual Disclosure Form (Best Practice)

**Organizations:** PKUAA-NE, SJTU-SV (implied), all well-governed 501(c)(3)s

**Description:** All Directors complete an annual disclosure form at the start of each year, listing:
- Business interests that could conflict with organization decisions
- Family members employed by or contracting with the organization
- Board memberships in other organizations

**Why Valuable:**
- Creates a proactive disclosure culture rather than reactive crisis management
- Identifies potential conflicts before they become actual conflicts
- Documents that the organization takes COI seriously

**Note:** The annual disclosure form is typically adopted by the Board as a separate policy and not included in the bylaws themselves.

## Recommendations for SCUT Alumni America

### High Priority

1. **Add a conflict of interest provision to the bylaws.** At minimum, include:
   - Disclosure obligation: Directors must disclose material financial interests in matters before the Board
   - Recusal: Interested Directors must abstain from voting (and ideally from discussion) on such matters
   - Documentation: Minutes must record the disclosure and the recusal

2. **Adopt a separate Board-approved COI policy.** The IRS Form 990 asks about this; having a written policy is a governance best practice regardless of 501(c)(7) status. Use the IRS model conflict of interest policy (available from the IRS website) as a starting point.

### Medium Priority

3. **Implement an annual disclosure process.** At the first Board meeting of each year, ask all Directors to disclose any interests that might conflict with organizational decisions during the coming year. Document in the minutes.

### Recommended Bylaw Language (Minimal Version)

```
Section X — Conflict of Interest

Any Director or officer who has a personal financial interest, or whose family member, employer, or associated organization has a financial interest, in a matter being considered by the Board shall:

(a) Disclose the nature and extent of the interest at the beginning of the relevant Board discussion;

(b) Abstain from voting on the matter; and

(c) Leave the meeting room during the Board's consideration and vote, if requested by a majority of the remaining Directors.

The Board shall document the disclosure and the recusal in the meeting minutes. The Board may adopt a separate conflict of interest policy providing additional detail.
```

This minimal provision satisfies California Corp. Code §7233's requirements and establishes the essential disclosure-and-recusal framework without over-complicating the bylaws.
