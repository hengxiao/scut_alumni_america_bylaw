# Policy Questions: Conflict of Interest

These are the questions the organization must answer before drafting the conflict of interest provisions of the revised By-Laws. Each question reflects a real policy choice rather than a legal requirement.

## 1. What should count as a "conflict of interest" for purposes of this policy?

The organization must define the trigger for the conflict of interest process. A conflict typically arises when a director or officer has a personal financial or personal interest in a matter before the Board, but the scope can be broader.
- Should the policy cover only financial conflicts (e.g., a director votes on a contract with a vendor where the director has an ownership stake), or also personal relationships (e.g., a director votes to hire their spouse as an event vendor)?
- Should the policy cover situations where a director's employer or another organization they lead has an interest in the matter?
- Should the policy cover situations where a director could personally benefit indirectly — for example, a director voting to hold the annual banquet at a venue they own through a family member?
- Should there be a materiality threshold — minor or theoretical conflicts that do not require disclosure?

## 2. Who is subject to the conflict of interest policy?

- Should the policy apply only to Board directors, or also to officers, committee chairs, and committee members?
- Should it apply to the President in the same way as other directors — or should the President, as the senior executive, be held to an even higher standard?
- Should advisory board members or volunteers with significant organizational authority be subject to any version of this policy?

## 3. How must a conflict be disclosed, and to whom?

- Should a director disclose a conflict at the beginning of the meeting where the matter will be discussed, before discussion begins?
- Should directors be required to proactively disclose potential conflicts in advance (e.g., in writing to the Secretary before the meeting) rather than waiting until the item is raised at the meeting?
- Should the organization require an annual written disclosure from all directors, listing any relationships or interests that could constitute a conflict — so the Board is not relying solely on spontaneous disclosure?
- Who receives a disclosure — the full Board, the Secretary, the President, or a dedicated Conflict of Interest Committee?

## 4. May an interested director participate in discussion, or must they leave the room?

This is a particularly sensitive policy choice because small organizations often have few directors and removing one from discussion can significantly affect outcomes.
- Should an interested director be permitted to answer factual questions from the Board before leaving the room for the decision?
- Should an interested director be required to leave the meeting room entirely during deliberation and voting, or simply abstain from voting while remaining present?
- If the interested director is the only person with specific knowledge needed to evaluate the matter, should there be an exception allowing them to present information but not vote?

## 5. What vote threshold applies when an interested director is excluded?

When a director is recused, the composition of the voting group changes.
- Should quorum for the vote on the conflicted matter be calculated based on the number of non-interested directors only?
- Should the vote require approval from a majority of disinterested directors, regardless of the quorum threshold that normally applies?
- If recusing the interested director would leave the Board without a quorum, what happens — is the matter deferred, or is there a special rule for such situations?

## 6. How must the process and outcome be documented?

- Should the minutes of every meeting where a conflict was disclosed record: the name of the interested director, the nature of the interest, whether they were recused, whether they left the room, the vote count among disinterested directors, and the outcome?
- Should this documentation be kept as a separate conflict of interest log, distinct from the regular meeting minutes?
- Should the organization be required to retain conflict of interest records for a minimum period (e.g., seven years) to support any future audit or legal review?

---

## 7. What are the consequences for failing to disclose a known conflict?

The policy is only effective if there are real consequences for ignoring it.
- Should a failure to disclose a material conflict be grounds for removal from the Board?
- Should a transaction that was approved without proper disclosure of a conflict be voidable — i.e., can the Board rescind it?
- Should there be a graduated response — a warning for a first failure to disclose, and removal proceedings for a repeat or egregious failure?
- Who initiates a review if a potential undisclosed conflict is discovered after the fact — any director, the President, or a committee?
