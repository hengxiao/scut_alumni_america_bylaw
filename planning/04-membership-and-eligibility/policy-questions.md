# Policy Questions: Membership and Eligibility

These are the questions the organization must answer before drafting the membership and eligibility article of the revised By-Laws. Each question reflects a real policy choice rather than a legal requirement.

---

## 1. Who exactly is eligible for membership?

The current By-Laws say any person who "worked or studied at SCUT and currently lives or works in America" may join. Several ambiguities should be resolved:
- Does "studied at SCUT" include people who attended SCUT for short programs, exchange semesters, or summer courses — or only people who received a degree?
- Does "worked at SCUT" include staff, faculty, and administrators, or only alumni in the traditional sense?
- Does "currently lives or works in America" need to be satisfied at the time of joining, on an ongoing basis, or both? What happens if a member moves back to China?
- Are current SCUT students studying in the U.S. on exchange eligible, even if they have not yet graduated?
- Are graduate students at U.S. universities who hold a SCUT undergraduate degree eligible?

## 2. Should family members or associates of SCUT alumni be eligible for any form of membership?

Many alumni organizations offer a broader membership category for spouses, domestic partners, or family members of alumni, or for friends of the organization who are not themselves alumni.
- Should a "family membership" or "associate membership" category be created?
- If so, what rights and limitations would such members have — can they vote, hold office, or attend all events?
- Would associate members count toward quorum calculations or petition thresholds?

---

## 3. What is the formal process for becoming a member?

There is currently no registration or application process. The organization must decide:
- Must a person submit a formal membership application (paper or online form)?
- Who reviews and approves applications — the Secretary, the Board, or is it self-service upon payment of dues?
- What information must an applicant provide (name, graduation year, degree, SCUT student/employee ID, current location, contact information)?
- Is any verification of SCUT affiliation required, and if so, how is it conducted?

---

## 4. Who maintains the official membership roll, and what does it contain?

Without a defined membership roll, the organization cannot calculate quorum, petition thresholds, or voting eligibility. The organization should decide:
- Is the Secretary responsible for maintaining the membership roll, or should a separate Membership Officer or committee be designated?
- What information is recorded for each member (name, contact details, membership type, join date, dues payment status)?
- How often is the roll updated, and who has access to it?
- Should the roll be shared with the full Board? With the general membership?

---

## 5. What should membership dues be, and how should the dues structure work?

The current By-Laws say dues are "determined by the Board from time to time" with no further structure. The organization should decide:
- Should dues be fixed in the By-Laws (e.g., $30/year), or should the Board retain full discretion to set the amount?
- Should dues be annual, or can members pay for multiple years at once?
- Should there be different dues levels — for example, a standard rate, a reduced rate for students or recent graduates, and a lifetime membership option?
- Are dues waived for founding members, officers, or board members?
- Through what channels are dues collected (check, PayPal, Zelle, Venmo, bank transfer)?

---

## 6. What happens when a member does not pay dues?

There is currently no process for membership lapse due to non-payment.
- After how many days or months of non-payment does a member lose good standing?
- Does a lapsed member lose voting rights immediately, or only after a grace period?
- Should lapsed members receive a reminder before their membership lapses?
- Can a lapsed member be reinstated by paying back dues, or do they need to apply anew?

---

## 7. Should there be a process for suspending or revoking membership?

There is no current provision for removing a member for misconduct.
- Should members be subject to suspension or expulsion for behavior that violates the By-Laws or harms the organization?
- What process is required — a hearing, a board vote, a right to appeal?
- Who initiates a disciplinary proceeding — any member, any board member, or the President only?
- Should the standard of proof be specified (e.g., a majority board vote after a fair hearing)?

---

## 8. Should membership be tiered, with different rights for different categories?

The organization may wish to distinguish between different levels of engagement:
- **Active members** — paid dues, full voting and candidacy rights
- **Inactive or lapsed members** — not in good standing, no voting rights
- **Student members** — current SCUT students in the U.S., possibly at a reduced rate with limited rights
- **Honorary members** — recognized for special contributions, with non-voting status
- **Life members** — one-time payment, permanent membership

Should these distinctions be encoded in the By-Laws, or left to Board policy?

---

## 9. What notice period should apply to membership meetings?

The current one-week notice is very short for an organization whose members may be spread across multiple time zones and states.
- Should the notice period for the annual membership meeting be extended to at least 30 days?
- Should advance notice include a draft agenda so members can prepare to participate?
- Should notice be sent through multiple channels (email, WeChat, website posting) to maximize reach?
