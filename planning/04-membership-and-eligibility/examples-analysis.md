## How the 10 Reference Organizations Handle Membership

### Overview of Approaches

| Dimension | Range Across Examples |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Membership categories | Single tier vs. 2–4 tiers (Regular, Associate, Honorary, Student) |
| Eligibility definition | Graduates only vs. any affiliated person (faculty, staff, students) |
| Geographic requirement | Explicit geographic zone vs. nationwide vs. no requirement |
| Dues | Required (all organizations except HCSSA) |
| Honorary membership | Almost universal (8 of 10 organizations) |
| Student membership | Minority (SJTU-SV, HCSSA) |

---

## Model 1: Single-Category Open Membership (Alumni Only)

**Organizations:** PUAASC, XTUAANA, CTUAAA

**Description:** Membership is open to any graduate of the university (or any person who attended), with a single membership category requiring annual dues payment to be in good standing.

**PUAASC Approach:**
> Any alumnus of Peking University who resides or works in Southern California. Annual dues required for good standing.

**XTUAANA Approach:**
> Any alumnus of Xiangtan University (or spouse of alumnus). Annual dues required.

**Pros:**
- Simple and easy to administer
- No debates about which category a person falls into
- Appropriate for organizations where nearly all members share the same profile (university graduates)
- SCUT Alumni America's current approach

**Cons:**
- Excludes faculty, research staff, and long-term lab affiliates who may be deeply connected to SCUT
- No provision for students (current SCUT students in the US are a natural membership pipeline)
- Honorary membership (if desired) requires adding a separate category
- No associate membership for those outside the service area who wish to stay connected

## Model 2: Two-Tier Membership (Regular + Honorary)

**Organizations:** PUAASC (with Honorary), TAAGNY (Regular + Out-of-Area + Honorary)

**Description:** Core Regular membership for the primary constituency; Honorary membership for distinguished supporters who do not meet the regular eligibility criteria.

**TAAGNY Approach:**
> Regular Members: Tsinghua alumni residing or working in the greater New York area.
> Out-of-Area Members: Tsinghua alumni outside New York — all benefits except voting and office eligibility.
> Honorary Members: Persons with outstanding contributions; elected by 2/3 Board vote; no dues.

**PKUAA-NE Approach:**
> Regular + Associate (out-of-area) + Honorary. Mirrors TAAGNY's structure.

**Pros:**
- Recognizes distinguished supporters without compromising the alumni-based core
- Out-of-Area / Associate category keeps geographically dispersed alumni engaged
- Clear voting rights distinction prevents governance issues (Honorary members observe; Regular members vote)
- Appropriate for SCUT Alumni America's national footprint (many SCUT alumni outside Bay Area)

**Cons:**
- Honorary membership elections can become politically sensitive (who is "distinguished enough"?)
- Out-of-Area membership requires additional tracking and communication infrastructure
- Two tiers still excludes current students, faculty, and non-alumnus supporters

## Model 3: Multi-Tier Membership (Regular + Associate + Student + Honorary)

**Organizations:** SJTU-SV, FDAAGLA

**Description:** Four distinct membership categories, each with defined eligibility, dues, and governance rights.

**SJTU-SV Approach:**
> - **Regular Members:** SJTU graduates or alumni; full voting rights and office eligibility
> - **Associate Members:** Spouses/partners of Regular Members, or SJTU students in the Bay Area; voting rights, but not eligible for office
> - **Student Members:** Current SJTU students in Bay Area; reduced dues; limited governance rights
> - **Honorary Members:** Distinguished contributors; no dues; advisory only

**FDAAGLA Approach:**
> - **General Members:** Must have studied at Fudan University for at least 2 years; full rights
> - **Associate Members:** Fudan affiliates who do not meet the 2-year requirement; limited voting rights
> - **Honorary Members:** Distinguished contributors elected by Board; no dues, no vote

**Pros:**
- Explicitly includes current students — the most natural pipeline for future alumni members
- Defines clear rights for each category, reducing ambiguity
- Spousal/partner membership (Associate) reflects the reality of community events where families participate
- Can set different dues levels appropriate to each category (student dues < regular dues)
- The 2-year study requirement (FDAAGLA) prevents tenuous affiliation claims

**Cons:**
- Administrative complexity: tracking four categories of membership
- Risk of disputes at the margins ("Do I qualify for Regular or Associate?")
- If student membership is active but transient, organizational culture can become destabilized by high turnover
- May require California law compliance for defining different voting rights among categories

## Model 4: Open/Interest-Based Membership

**Organizations:** HCSSA, OCA

**Description:** Not limited to graduates of a specific university — open to all who share the mission or have an affiliation.

**HCSSA Approach:**
> Open to all students and scholars at Harvard University, "regardless of nationality, ethnicity, or background."

**OCA Approach:**
> Open to any person who subscribes to OCA's mission and pays applicable dues.

**Relevance to SCUT Alumni America:** This model is NOT directly applicable — SCUT Alumni America is by definition an alumni association. However, OCA's open model is instructive if the organization ever considers broadening to serve the broader Chinese-American professional community in the Bay Area.

## Membership Eligibility: "Who Counts as a SCUT Alumnus?"

This is a critical policy question. The reference organizations handle it differently:

| Organization | Eligibility Definition |
|---|---|
| PUAASC | "Graduated from Peking University" |
| PKUAA-NE | "Graduated from or studied at Peking University" |
| FDAAGLA | "Studied at Fudan University for at least 2 years" |
| TAAGNY | "Graduated from, studied at, or been employed as faculty or research staff at Tsinghua University" |
| SJTU-SV | "Graduated from SJTU or is a current SJTU student in the Bay Area" |
| USTCAF | "Has donated $20+ annually" (donor-based, not credential-based) |
| XTUAANA | "Alumni or spouse of alumni of Xiangtan University" |

**Key Insight:** TAAGNY's broad definition (graduates + any student + faculty + research staff) is the most inclusive and likely captures the actual SCUT community better than a graduates-only definition. Many SCUT alumni in the US include people who studied for 1–2 years as exchange students, researchers, or postdoctoral fellows.

## Dues Structure Comparison

| Organization | Annual Dues (Approximate) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PUAASC | $30 individual | Fixed rate |
| PKUAA-NE | Board-set; student reduced | Tiered |
| USTCAF | $20 minimum donation | Donation model |
| FDAAGLA | Board-set | Tiered (General vs. Associate) |
| XTUAANA | Board-set | Fixed |
| SJTU-SV | Board-set; student reduced | Multi-tier |
| TAAGNY | Board-set; student/senior reduced; life membership available | Multi-tier |
| OCA | Board-set; student/low-income reduced | Accessibility focus |

**Key Finding:** The consensus approach is Board-set dues (not hardcoded in bylaws), with reduced rates for students and low-income members. Hardcoding dues in bylaws requires a bylaw amendment to change — bad practice.

## Voting Rights and Good Standing

| Organization | Who Can Vote | Good Standing Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| PUAASC | Regular members in good standing | Dues current |
| PKUAA-NE | Regular members in good standing | Dues current; not suspended |
| FDAAGLA | General Members only | No proxy voting |
| TAAGNY | Regular members only (not Out-of-Area, not Honorary) | Dues current |
| SJTU-SV | Regular members only | Dues current |
| HCSSA | Any member with valid Harvard email | Harvard enrollment |
| OCA | Individual members at Convention | Dues current |

**Key Finding:** All organizations restrict voting rights to Regular/primary-tier members in good standing. Associate, Honorary, Out-of-Area, and Student members typically have limited or no voting rights.

---

## Proxy Voting

| Organization | Proxy Voting |
|---|---|
| FDAAGLA | **Explicitly prohibited** |
| PKUAA-NE | Permitted under California law default |
| SJTU-SV | Not addressed (California law applies) |
| Most others | Not addressed |

**FDAAGLA Notable Provision:**
> "Proxy voting is not permitted at any meeting of FDAAGLA. All votes must be cast in person by the member present."

**Analysis:** FDAAGLA's explicit prohibition prevents strategic proxy collection by organized factions. However, it also suppresses participation by members who cannot attend in-person. For a geographically distributed membership like SCUT Alumni America, proxy voting (or electronic voting as an alternative) is likely important.

## Recommendations for SCUT Alumni America

### Highest Priority

1. **Broaden the eligibility definition beyond graduates-only.** Consider including:
   - SCUT graduates ✓
   - Former students (studied at SCUT, even if degree not from SCUT)
   - SCUT faculty and research staff who are in the US
   - Current SCUT students studying in the US (as Student members)

2. **Add Student membership category.** SJTU-SV's student category explicitly includes current SCUT students studying in the Bay Area. These individuals are the natural next generation of regular members and a recruitment pipeline. Reduced dues ($0 or minimal) are appropriate.

3. **Add Honorary membership category.** Nearly every peer organization has this. It allows recognizing distinguished supporters (professors, community leaders, corporate sponsors) who are not SCUT alumni but have meaningfully contributed.

### Secondary Considerations

4. **Set dues by Board resolution, not in bylaws.** All mature organizations in this sample set dues by Board decision, not in bylaws. This avoids requiring a bylaw amendment every time dues need adjustment.

5. **Provide reduced dues for new arrivals.** Several organizations (TAAGNY, OCA) have student and low-income reduced rates. For SCUT Alumni America's mission of supporting new arrivals, a reduced first-year membership rate for newly arrived alumni would align dues policy with mission.

6. **Clarify the geographic scope of "Regular" membership.** If SCUT Alumni America is a national organization (all of America), should there be a geographic distinction? If it is Bay Area-focused, are SCUT alumni in New York or Texas members or not? TAAGNY's Out-of-Area Associate category is a practical solution for national organizations with a geographic base.

7. **Address the proxy voting question explicitly.** Either explicitly permit it (with a limit per proxy holder, e.g., no more than 5 proxies per person) or explicitly prohibit it and instead authorize electronic/absentee voting. California nonprofit law permits both approaches when the bylaws address the question.
