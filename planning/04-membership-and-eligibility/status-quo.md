# Status Quo: Membership and Eligibility

## What the Current By-Laws Say

**Article IV — Memberships**

- **Qualifications (§1):** An individual who worked or studied at SCUT and currently lives or works in America may become a member.
- **Rights and Obligations (§2):**
  - Right to elect or be elected to the Board.
  - Right to enjoy all benefits sponsored by the organization.
  - Obligation to follow the By-Laws and Board decisions.
- **Membership Fees (§3):** Members pay a fee determined by the Board from time to time.
- **Membership Meeting (§4):** Regular meetings held once a year; special meetings may be called by a majority of the Board. Notice given at least one week in advance by writing or email.

## Gaps and Observations

- No registration or application process is defined. It is unclear how one formally "becomes" a member.
- No one is designated as the keeper of the official membership roll.
- "Currently lives or works in America" is informal; it is unclear whether this applies at the time of joining, continuously, or both.
- No provision for what happens if a member moves outside the U.S. temporarily or permanently.
- No distinction between active and inactive members.
- No process for membership lapse due to non-payment of dues.
- No process for terminating or revoking membership.
- Without a defined membership roll, thresholds based on percentage of members (e.g., the 10% petition threshold in Art. VIII) cannot be calculated.
- Notice period for membership meetings is only one week — very short for members spread across the country.
