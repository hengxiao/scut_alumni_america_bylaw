## How the 10 Reference Organizations Handle Leadership Structure

### Overview of Approaches

The reference organizations use four distinct structural models for leadership:

| Model | Organizations | Core Characteristic |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Board + Officers** (Board elects officers) | PKUAA-NE, USTCAF, TAAGNY, FDAAGLA | Directors elected by members; Board then elects officers from among Directors |
| **Direct Officer Election** | PUAASC, XTUAANA, CTUAAA | Members elect officers directly, officers serve as or on a Board |
| **Executive Committee** | USTCAF, SJTU-SV | Small executive body (3–5 persons) handles day-to-day decisions |
| **Convention/Delegate Model** | OCA | Officers elected by delegates at annual convention |

## Model 1: Board Elects Officers (Separation of Governance and Execution)

**Organizations:** PKUAA-NE, TAAGNY, FDAAGLA, SJTU-SV

**Description:** Members elect a Board of Directors at the annual meeting. The Board then elects officers (President, Vice Presidents, Secretary, Treasurer) from among its own members at the first post-election Board meeting. Officers exercise executive authority; the Board provides governance oversight.

**Example Structure (TAAGNY):**
> Board: 7–25 Directors, 2-year terms, 3-term limit. Officers: President + First VP + Second VP + additional functional VPs + Secretary + Treasurer, elected by Board from among Directors. President limited to 2 consecutive terms in that office.

**Example Structure (SJTU-SV):**
> Board: 9–21 Directors, 2-year terms, 3-term limit. Officers: President, First VP, Second VP, Secretary, Treasurer — elected by Board. Officers form an Executive Committee for between-meeting decisions.

**Pros:**
- Clear separation between governance (Board) and management (officers) reflects best nonprofit practice
- Board can remove or replace officers without a full membership vote if an officer underperforms
- Prevents personality-driven elections — voters choose governance capacity (Directors), not personalities (who runs for President)
- Officers tend to have stronger Board relationships since they were selected by the Board
- Consistent with California nonprofit law governance expectations

**Cons:**
- Members have less direct say in who becomes President — may feel less democratic
- Requires larger, active Board to function well; if Board is passive, officers have unchecked power
- More complex structure to explain and administer
- Requires two governance events: member election of Directors + Board election of officers

## Model 2: Direct Member Election of Officers

**Organizations:** PUAASC, XTUAANA, OCA (via convention), HCSSA

**Description:** Members vote directly for President, Vice Presidents, Secretary, and Treasurer. Officers may collectively constitute the Board, or the Board may include additional at-large directors.

**Example Structure (PUAASC):**
> Members elect all officers at the annual meeting. Officers collectively govern between annual meetings.

**Example Structure (OCA):**
> Delegates at the annual convention elect national officers and Board members. President and officers are elected by the convention and serve as national leaders.

**Pros:**
- More directly democratic — members choose their president
- Simpler to understand and administer (one election event)
- Appropriate for organizations where the presidency is a high-profile leadership role
- Matches SCUT Alumni America's current practice

**Cons:**
- Elections can become personality-driven popularity contests rather than governance capability assessments
- No internal check if a popular but ineffective president is elected
- Removing an underperforming officer requires calling a special membership meeting
- Less separation between governance and operations

## Model 3: Executive Committee for Between-Meeting Authority

**Organizations:** USTCAF, SJTU-SV

**Description:** A small Executive Committee (typically 3–5 persons: President + key officers) is authorized to act on behalf of the full Board between Board meetings. Actions are subject to Board ratification.

**Example Structure (USTCAF):**
> Executive Committee of 3 members: Chairperson, Vice Chairperson, Secretary. EC handles operational decisions between General Board meetings. EC actions must be reported to and ratified by the General Board.

**Example Structure (SJTU-SV):**
> 5-member Executive Committee: President, First VP, Second VP, Secretary, Treasurer. EC meets regularly; full Board meets at least 4 times/year.

**Pros:**
- Enables rapid decision-making without convening the full Board for routine matters
- Appropriate for organizations with large Boards (9+ Directors) where full Board is unwieldy for operational decisions
- EC members bear clear accountability for operational decisions
- Creates a leadership pipeline (EC experience prepares future officers)

**Cons:**
- Risk of EC becoming the de facto governing body, marginalizing other Directors
- Requires clear charter: what can EC decide unilaterally vs. what requires full Board?
- Board members who are not on EC may feel excluded from meaningful governance
- Adds a layer of complexity that small organizations may not need

## Model 4: Functional Vice Presidents with Differentiated Portfolios

**Organizations:** TAAGNY, OCA, SJTU-SV

**Description:** Instead of generic "Vice President 1, Vice President 2" roles, each VP has a specific functional portfolio (Events, Membership, Programs, Young Alumni, External Relations, etc.).

**Example Structure (TAAGNY):**
> First VP: Acts as President in absence, coordinates programs; Second VP: Oversees chapter relations; Additional VPs: Events, Membership, Young Alumni, Professional Development (as Board determines).

**Example Structure (OCA):**
> First VP: Acts as President in absence; Second VP: Oversees chapter relations and development.

**Comparison with SCUT Alumni America:**
> SCUT Alumni America's current bylaws allow "up to six Vice Chairmen" but do not define their roles. This creates ambiguity about accountability.

**Pros:**
- Clear accountability: each VP owns specific organizational functions
- Prevents duplication of effort and gaps in coverage
- Provides leadership development opportunities — VPs can specialize and grow in their domain
- Makes the organization chart legible to members and potential partners

**Cons:**
- Requires thoughtful portfolio design at the outset; poorly designed portfolios create friction
- Risk of siloed thinking if VPs do not collaborate across portfolios
- If a VP with a key portfolio leaves, that function is disrupted until replacement is found
- May require more VPs than the organization can recruit (e.g., six VP roles with only four willing candidates)

## Model 5: The National Federation Structure

**Organizations:** CTUAAA, OCA

**Description:** The national organization's Board includes representatives from local chapters (proportional to chapter size), rather than all Directors being at-large members elected by the full membership.

**Example Structure (CTUAAA):**
> Board composed of chapter representatives; each chapter sends 1–2 Directors based on chapter membership size. National officers are elected from the Board.

**Example Structure (OCA):**
> Board includes elected national officers + chapter representatives + at-large Directors. No more than 25 total Board members.

**Relevance to SCUT Alumni America:** Not directly applicable unless SCUT Alumni America adopts a chapter structure. However, if the organization grows to have distinct Bay Area sub-regional groups or national chapters, this model provides a governance template.

## Board Size Comparison

| Organization | Board Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PUAASC | 11 Directors (current) | 11–21 range |
| PKUAA-NE | 7–15 Directors | 2-year terms |
| USTCAF | Not fixed — General Board | Functional model |
| FDAAGLA | Not specified | ~7–15 typical |
| XTUAANA | 11–21 Directors | Same as SCUT |
| CTUAAA | Chapter-proportional | Federation model |
| SJTU-SV | 9–21 Directors | Board elects officers |
| HCSSA | Executive Board only | No separate Board |
| TAAGNY | 7–25 Directors | Large org, large range |
| OCA | Max 25 | Officers + chapters + at-large |

## Recommendations for SCUT Alumni America

### Highest Priority

1. **Define Vice Chairman portfolios.** Rather than "up to six Vice Chairmen" with no role definition, assign each VP a specific portfolio aligned with the organization's actual functions. Based on Bay Area SCUT activities, likely portfolios include: Events, Membership/Outreach, Finance Oversight, SCUT Liaison/University Relations, Young Alumni/New Arrivals, and Communications.

2. **Consider the Board-elects-officers model.** Transitioning from direct member election of officers to a Board-elected-officer model improves governance quality but requires member buy-in. This is a significant structural change that should be presented transparently to members.

### Secondary Considerations

3. **Consider whether a formal Executive Committee is needed.** If the Board has more than 9 Directors, an Executive Committee of the top 3–5 officers to handle between-meeting decisions is worth formalizing. If the Board is smaller, this may be unnecessary complexity.

4. **Set a clear Board size range with both minimum and maximum.** TAAGNY's 7–25 range provides maximum flexibility. SCUT Alumni America might consider 7–21 to lower the minimum from 11, providing more flexibility if recruitment is challenging.

5. **Plan for future federation structure.** If SCUT Alumni America seeks to establish a national presence or coordinate with other SCUT alumni groups in the US, designing the Board structure to eventually accommodate chapter representation is worth doing now.
