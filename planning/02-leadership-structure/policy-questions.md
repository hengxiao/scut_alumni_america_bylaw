# Policy Questions: Leadership Structure

These are the questions the organization must answer before drafting the leadership structure article of the revised By-Laws. Each question reflects a real policy choice rather than a legal requirement.

## 1. How large should the Board of Directors be?

The current By-Laws set a range of 11 to 21 directors. The organization should decide:
- Is this range still appropriate, or should it be narrowed (e.g., 9–15) to make quorum more predictable and meetings more manageable?
- Should the size be fixed (e.g., exactly 15 directors) rather than a range, to avoid ambiguity about what a "majority of the authorized number" means at any given time?
- Is a minimum of 11 realistic given the organization's current level of active member participation? If the organization frequently struggles to fill all seats, a lower minimum may be more practical.

## 2. Should officer titles be modernized?

The current titles — Chairman, Vice Chairmen — use gendered language and a governance style more common in older corporate structures. Options include:
- Adopting "President" and "Vice President" as more familiar and gender-neutral titles
- Using "Chair" and "Vice Chair" to keep the board-oriented framing
- Keeping the existing titles to preserve continuity and institutional recognition

If titles are changed, should Chinese-language equivalents (used informally within the community) also be updated?

## 3. How many Vice Presidents / Vice Chairs should there be, and should their roles be differentiated?

The current By-Laws allow up to six Vice Chairmen with no differentiation between their roles. The organization should decide:
- Should there be fewer Vice Chairs (e.g., 2–3) with more clearly defined portfolios (e.g., one overseeing internal affairs, one overseeing external relations, one overseeing events)?
- Or should the current model be retained, where Vice Chairs are fungible deputies who share the same responsibilities?
- If roles are differentiated, should each portfolio be defined in the By-Laws, or left to the Board to assign after each election?

## 4. Should the Board have an Executive Committee with delegated authority to act between full Board meetings?

Because the full Board meets infrequently, some organizations create a smaller Executive Committee (typically the President, Vice Presidents, Secretary, and Treasurer) that can make routine decisions without waiting for a full Board meeting.
- Should such a committee be formalized in the By-Laws?
- What decisions can the Executive Committee make on its own, and which must be reserved for the full Board?
- Would this create a two-tier governance structure that sidelines the broader Board?

## 5. Should additional officer roles be formally recognized?

In practice, the organization may have members who manage the website, coordinate WeChat communications, run specific events, or handle public relations. Currently none of these roles have any By-Law standing.
- Should a Communications Officer or Digital Operations Officer role be created?
- Should an Events Coordinator or Programs Officer role be recognized?
- Should these be Board-level officer positions or committee-level roles?
- Should the By-Laws enumerate these roles explicitly, or give the Board the power to create and define additional roles as needed?

---

## 6. What happens when the President and all Vice Presidents are unavailable?

The current By-Laws say Vice Chairmen exercise the Chairman's duties when the Chairman is absent, but say nothing about what happens when all of them are unavailable simultaneously.
- Should the By-Laws establish a clear line of succession beyond the Vice Presidents (e.g., the Secretary assumes the Chair's duties next)?
- Should there be a procedure for an emergency appointment when no named officer is available?

---

## 7. Should there be term limits, and should terms be staggered?

Under the current By-Laws, all directors serve three-year terms with no staggering — the entire board can turn over at once, creating a risk of losing institutional knowledge.
- Should terms be staggered (e.g., one-third of the Board elected each year on a three-year cycle)?
- Should there be a maximum number of consecutive terms a director or officer may serve?
- If term limits are imposed, should there be a cooling-off period before a termed-out director can run again?

---

## 8. What is the relationship between the Board and the general membership?

The current By-Laws vest all governing power in the Board, with the membership having the right to elect the Board and to vote on By-Law amendments. The organization should clarify:
- Are there any decisions that the Board must put to a membership vote beyond By-Law amendments (e.g., major expenditures, dissolution, significant strategic changes)?
- Should the membership have a formal right to petition the Board to take up a specific issue?
- Should the membership meeting have a standing agenda item for members to raise concerns or proposals?
