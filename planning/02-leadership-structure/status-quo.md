# Status Quo: Leadership / Executive Structure

## What the Current By-Laws Say

**Article V — Board of Directors**
- Governing powers are vested in the Board of Directors (§1).
- Minimum 11, maximum 21 board members (§2).
- Board duties include managing activities, record-keeping, calling meetings, appointing officers, planning activities, and fulfilling organizational purposes (§3).

**Article VI — Executive Officers**
- Officers consist of: one Chairman of the Board, up to six Vice Chairmen, one Secretary, and one Treasurer (§1).
- All serve three-year terms.
- Chairman is the chief executive officer and presides at all meetings (§2).
- Vice Chairmen exercise the Chairman's duties when the Chairman is absent (§3).
- Secretary keeps records, keeps the seal, issues notices, and performs other assigned duties (§4).
- Treasurer manages all financial accounts, co-signs checks, submits annual accounts, and holds bank books (§5).

## Gaps and Observations

- No organizational chart or explicit chain of command is defined.
- No mention of what happens when both the Chairman and all Vice Chairmen are unavailable.
- Roles use gendered titles (Chairman, Vice Chairmen) and gendered pronouns throughout.
- The relationship between the Board and the Officers is described but the division of authority is not clearly bounded.
- No provision for additional roles (e.g., committee chairs, webmaster, communications officer) that exist in practice.
