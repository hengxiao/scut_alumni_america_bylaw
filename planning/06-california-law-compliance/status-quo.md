# Status Quo: California Civil Law Compliance

## What the Current By-Laws Say

**Article I §2:** States that the organization is incorporated in California as a Non-Profit Mutual Benefit Corporation.

**Article III §3:** States that the organization shall not participate in political activities or activities that jeopardize its tax-exempt status.

No other provisions explicitly reference California law.

## Gaps and Observations

The current By-Laws make no reference to specific requirements of the California Corporations Code (Title 3, Part 3 — Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation Law), including but not limited to:

- Director inspection rights (Corp. Code §8330 et seq.)
- Member inspection rights (Corp. Code §8330 et seq.)
- Requirements for action by written consent without a meeting
- Required disclosures at membership meetings
- Director conflict of interest rules (Corp. Code §5233 applicable by reference or analogy)
- Indemnification of directors and officers
- Requirements for dissolution and asset distribution

Additionally, there is no reference to federal tax obligations relevant to the organization's non-profit status.

This topic requires legal research to identify which provisions are mandatory and which the organization has discretion over.
