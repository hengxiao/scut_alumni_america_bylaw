# Policy Questions: California Law Compliance

These are the questions the organization must answer before drafting the California law compliance provisions of the revised By-Laws. Each question reflects a real policy choice (rather than a legal requirement that is mandatory in all cases).

## 1. Should the By-Laws explicitly reference the California Corporations Code, or simply be written to comply with it?

Some organizations include specific statutory citations in their By-Laws (e.g., "as permitted by California Corporations Code §8322") so it is clear where By-Law provisions come from. Others prefer clean, readable language without statutory references, relying on legal counsel to ensure compliance.
- Does the organization prefer By-Laws that explicitly cite the Corporations Code where relevant?
- Or should statutory compliance be handled silently, with citations kept in internal legal notes rather than the governing document itself?
- This is partly a question of audience: are the By-Laws primarily a document for members and officers to use, or primarily a legal filing?

## 2. Should the By-Laws provide for indemnification of directors and officers?

California law permits nonprofit mutual benefit corporations to indemnify directors and officers against legal claims arising from their service. This can encourage capable people to serve by reducing personal liability risk.
- Should the organization provide indemnification for directors and officers who act in good faith in the performance of their duties?
- Should the indemnification be mandatory (they must be indemnified if they meet the conditions) or permissive (the Board decides case by case)?
- Should the organization purchase Directors and Officers (D&O) liability insurance to cover this exposure?
- What are the limits of indemnification — should it exclude acts of fraud, willful misconduct, or criminal behavior?

## 3. Should the By-Laws address member and director inspection rights?

California Corporations Code §8330 gives members of nonprofit mutual benefit corporations the right to inspect certain corporate records. The organization must decide how to handle this in practice:
- Should the By-Laws acknowledge and describe member inspection rights in accessible, plain-language terms so members know what they are entitled to see?
- Should the By-Laws specify the process for submitting an inspection request (who to contact, how much notice, what format)?
- Should the organization designate a specific officer to respond to inspection requests?
- Should any limits on inspection be stated (e.g., personal information about other members may be redacted)?

## 4. Should the By-Laws address limitations on director liability?

California law allows nonprofit mutual benefit corporations to limit or eliminate personal liability of directors for monetary damages in certain circumstances.
- Should the By-Laws include a liability limitation clause to protect directors who act in good faith?
- Should this protection extend to committee members who are not directors?
- What conduct should be excluded from liability protection (e.g., intentional misconduct, bad faith, conflicts of interest that were not disclosed)?

## 5. Should the organization maintain registered agent and principal office information in the By-Laws?

California law requires corporations to maintain a registered agent and a principal office in the state. The current By-Laws state the principal office is in San Jose, CA, but this may change as the organization's membership and leadership shift geographically.
- Should the By-Laws specify a particular city for the principal office, or simply state that the Board has authority to determine the location?
- Is the registered agent relationship documented anywhere, and should the By-Laws reference it?
- Who is responsible for updating the Secretary of State whenever the principal office or registered agent changes?

---

## 6. Should there be an explicit provision for annual reporting and filings with the California Secretary of State?

California requires nonprofit corporations to file a biennial Statement of Information with the Secretary of State. Failure to file can result in suspension of the corporation.
- Should the By-Laws explicitly assign responsibility for ensuring state filings are made on time?
- Should this be a named duty of the Secretary, the Treasurer, or a compliance officer?
- Should there be a Board-level check to verify that filings have been made each year?

---

## 7. How should the By-Laws handle the relationship between California law and the organization's own rules?

There will inevitably be cases where the By-Laws are silent on a matter that California law addresses. The organization should decide:
- Should there be a general provision stating that in any matter not addressed by the By-Laws, California Corporations Code (Title 3, Part 3) governs by default?
- Should conflicts between the By-Laws and California law be resolved explicitly in favor of California law, with a requirement to amend the By-Laws to bring them into compliance?
- Who is responsible for monitoring changes in California nonprofit law and alerting the Board when the By-Laws need to be updated?
