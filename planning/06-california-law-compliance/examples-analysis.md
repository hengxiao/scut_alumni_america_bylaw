## How the 10 Reference Organizations Handle California Law Compliance

### Preliminary Note on Scope

Only organizations incorporated in California must comply with California's Nonprofit Corporation Law. Four of the 10 reference organizations are relevant to this analysis:

| Organization | State | Applicable CA Law |
|---|---|---|
| PUAASC | California | Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation Law (Corp. Code §7110 et seq.) |
| FDAAGLA | California | Nonprofit (type not specified in bylaws; likely Mutual Benefit) |
| XTUAANA | California | Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law (Corp. Code §5110 et seq.) |
| SJTU-SV | California | Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation (501(c)(3) = public benefit) |
| PKUAA-NE | Massachusetts | Massachusetts Nonprofit Corporation Act |
| USTCAF | Delaware | Delaware General Corporation Law / Delaware nonprofit law |
| TAAGNY | New York | New York Not-for-Profit Corporation Law |
| CTUAAA | Not specified | Unknown |
| HCSSA | None (student org) | Harvard University policies |
| OCA | DC | DC Nonprofit Corporation Act |

**SCUT Alumni America** is organized under California law as a **Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation** (IRS 501(c)(7)). Its primary reference for California compliance is PUAASC (same legal form) and SJTU-SV (California nonprofit, though 501(c)(3)/Public Benefit).

## Issue 1: Dissolution Clause

**California Law Requirement (Corp. Code §7914):** Upon dissolution of a Mutual Benefit Corporation, assets must be distributed as specified in the bylaws or articles. If not specified, remaining assets after paying debts go to members (unlike Public Benefit Corporations, where assets must go to other nonprofits).

| Organization | Dissolution Provision |
|---|---|
| PUAASC | **Yes — complete dissolution article** specifying distribution to 501(c)(3) organizations serving Chinese-American community |
| PKUAA-NE | **Yes** — assets to 501(c)(3) educational/charitable organizations |
| USTCAF | **Yes** — assets to educational and charitable purposes consistent with USTC mission |
| FDAAGLA | **Yes** — distribution to charitable organizations |
| XTUAANA | **Missing** — no dissolution clause (critical gap) |
| SJTU-SV | **Yes** — assets to 501(c)(3) organizations |
| TAAGNY | **Yes** — assets to 501(c)(3) organizations serving educational/cultural exchange |
| OCA | **Yes** — assets to 501(c)(3) organizations serving AAPI community |

**XTUAANA Gap Analysis:**
XTUAANA (nearly identical template to SCUT Alumni America) is the most instructive cautionary tale. Its bylaws **completely lack a dissolution clause**, which is a significant legal deficiency. Without a dissolution clause, the default under California law for a Mutual Benefit Corporation is distribution to members — which may be incompatible with the organization's intent and could create tax complications.

**Best Practice (PUAASC):**
> "Upon dissolution of this Association, and after paying or adequately providing for the debts and obligations of the Association, the remaining assets shall be distributed to one or more organizations that are organized and operated exclusively for charitable, educational, religious, or scientific purposes and which qualify as exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, with preference given to organizations serving the Chinese-American community."

**Recommendation:** Add a dissolution clause modeled after PUAASC's language. Specifying that assets go to 501(c)(3) organizations (rather than to members) is both legally prudent and consistent with the organization's public-benefit purposes.

## Issue 2: Director Indemnification

**California Law (Corp. Code §7237):** California permits nonprofit corporations to indemnify Directors and officers for litigation-related expenses if they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the organization. Bylaws can expand, limit, or confirm this indemnification right.

| Organization | Indemnification Provision |
|---|---|
| PUAASC | **Yes** — explicit indemnification article |
| PKUAA-NE | **Yes** — to the fullest extent permitted by Massachusetts law |
| SJTU-SV | **Yes** — standard indemnification provision |
| FDAAGLA | Not found in bylaws |
| XTUAANA | **Missing** |
| TAAGNY | **Yes** — not explicit but referenced |
| Others | Vary |

**PUAASC Best Practice:**
> "The Association shall indemnify its Directors and officers against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding arising from their service to the Association, to the fullest extent permitted by the California Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation Law, provided that the person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the Association."

**Why This Matters:**
- Without indemnification, individual Directors may face personal liability for decisions made in good faith on the organization's behalf
- Indemnification provisions encourage qualified people to serve on the Board
- Most mature California nonprofits include this as standard language

**Recommendation:** Add an indemnification provision consistent with California Corp. Code §7237. This protects Directors from personal liability for good-faith governance decisions.

## Issue 3: Conflict of Interest Policy

**IRS and Best Practice Requirement:** For 501(c)(7) organizations, the IRS does not technically require a written conflict of interest policy (unlike 501(c)(3)). However, California's Attorney General's office strongly recommends a written COI policy for all nonprofit corporations. The California Nonprofit Integrity Act (2004) requires larger nonprofits to have COI policies.

| Organization | COI Policy |
|---|---|
| USTCAF | 501(c)(3) — IRS Form 990 requires COI policy disclosure; implied in articles |
| PKUAA-NE | Referenced in bylaws; separate policy document |
| SJTU-SV | Standard COI provision in bylaws |
| PUAASC | Referenced; separate policy document recommended |
| FDAAGLA, XTUAANA | Not explicitly addressed |

**SJTU-SV Best Practice:**
> Includes a conflict of interest article requiring Directors to disclose material interests in transactions under consideration, to recuse themselves from votes on transactions in which they have a conflict, and to have such conflicts reviewed by disinterested Directors.

**Recommendation:** Add at minimum a COI disclosure requirement in the bylaws. For simplicity, adopt a brief provision requiring any Director or officer with a material interest in a proposed transaction to disclose the interest and abstain from voting on it.

## Issue 4: Meeting Notice Requirements Under California Law

**California Law (Corp. Code §7211):** Board meetings require at least 4 days' advance notice when notice is given by first-class mail, or 48 hours by telegraph, fax, or email. Annual membership meetings require at least 10 days' notice for routine matters and 20 days for actions requiring member approval (e.g., amendments, dissolution).

| Organization | Board Meeting Notice | Annual Meeting Notice |
|---|---|---|
| PUAASC | 14 days | Not specified |
| PKUAA-NE | 7 days | 21 days |
| SJTU-SV | 7 days | Not specified |
| TAAGNY | 7 days | 21 days |
| OCA | 14 days (Board); 60 days (Convention) | 60 days |
| FDAAGLA | 7 days | 30 days |
| XTUAANA | Not specified | 30 days |

**Analysis:** California law sets floors (not ceilings) for notice periods. Most organizations in this sample use 7–14 days for Board meetings and 21–30 days for annual member meetings. These exceed California's minimums, which is appropriate for organizations that operate across geographies and need more lead time.

**Recommendation:** Specify at least:
- Board meetings: 7 days advance notice
- Annual membership meeting: 30 days advance notice (or 45 days if adopting longer-notice best practice)
- Special membership meetings: 10–14 days advance notice

---

## Issue 5: Electronic Participation in Meetings

**California Law (Corp. Code §7211(a)(6)):** California law permits Board members to participate in meetings via video conference or telephone if:
- The bylaws authorize it, OR
- All Directors consent to such participation for a particular meeting

For **member meetings**, electronic participation is more complex and requires explicit bylaw authorization.

| Organization | Virtual Meeting Authorization |
|---|---|
| FDAAGLA | **Explicitly authorized** — "meetings may be conducted via video conference" |
| SJTU-SV | **Explicitly authorized** |
| TAAGNY | **Explicitly authorized** |
| OCA | **Explicitly authorized** for Board |
| PUAASC | Not addressed |
| XTUAANA | Not addressed |

**Recommendation:** Explicitly authorize video conference participation for both Board meetings and member meetings. For member meetings, specify that electronic participation counts as attendance and that votes cast electronically are valid.

---

## Issue 6: Financial Controls Required by California Law

**California Law (Corp. Code §7215):** For nonprofits with gross revenues over certain thresholds, California requires:
- Annual financial statements reviewed or audited by an independent CPA (for organizations over $2 million in revenues)
- Financial statements made available to members upon request

| Organization | Financial Controls |
|---|---|
| OCA | **Mandatory annual CPA audit** (required by bylaws) |
| TAAGNY | "Board may engage CPA for annual review" (discretionary) |
| PKUAA-NE | $500 dual-signature threshold |
| SJTU-SV | $200 dual-signature threshold |
| PUAASC | Dual-signature required |
| XTUAANA | Not specified |

**Recommendation:**
- Add a dual-signature requirement for disbursements above a threshold (e.g., $500 or $1,000)
- Add a provision that the Board may engage a CPA for annual financial review when appropriate
- Ensure bylaws authorize the Board to make financial statements available to members upon request

## Recommendations for SCUT Alumni America

### Critical (Legal Compliance)

1. **Add a dissolution clause.** Model after PUAASC's language — assets to 501(c)(3) organizations upon dissolution. This is the single most important legal gap.

2. **Add a Director indemnification provision.** This protects Directors from personal liability for good-faith decisions and is standard in all mature California nonprofit bylaws.

### High Priority (Governance Best Practice)

3. **Add a conflict of interest disclosure requirement.** Even a simple one-paragraph provision (disclose + recuse) significantly improves governance quality.

4. **Add dual-signature financial controls.** Any disbursement above $500 (or a Board-set threshold) should require two authorized officer signatures.

5. **Authorize electronic meeting participation.** Explicitly permit video conference participation for both Board and member meetings.

### Medium Priority

6. **Specify meeting notice periods.** Do not rely on California law defaults, which are minimums. Set explicit notice periods: 7 days for Board, 30 days for annual member meeting.
