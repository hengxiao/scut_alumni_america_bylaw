## How the 10 Reference Organizations Handle Decision Processes

### Overview of Approaches

| Dimension | Range Across Examples |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Quorum (Board) | Majority of Directors (all orgs) |
| Quorum (Members) | Present at meeting (HCSSA) to fixed number (OCA: 20 chapters) |
| Voting threshold | Simple majority for routine actions; 2/3 supermajority for amendments |
| Proxy voting | Prohibited (FDAAGLA) to permitted (California law default) |
| Action by consent | Permitted without a meeting (PKUAA-NE, most mature orgs) |
| Electronic voting | Permitted (PKUAA-NE, TAAGNY, SJTU-SV) vs. not addressed |
| Runoff elections | Majority required with runoff if needed (HCSSA, OCA) |

---

## Dimension 1: Quorum Rules

### Board Quorum

The universal standard across all 10 organizations is **majority of Directors then serving** as the quorum for Board meetings. This is also the California nonprofit law default.

**All organizations:** A quorum for Board action = majority of Directors.

**Practical Implication for SCUT Alumni America:** If the Board has 15 Directors, quorum = 8. No Board meeting can take binding action without at least 8 Directors present (in person or via authorized electronic means). This is appropriate and should be maintained.

### Member Meeting Quorum

This is where organizations diverge significantly:

| Organization | Member Meeting Quorum |
|---|---|
| PUAASC | Not specified (California law default: majority of voting power) |
| PKUAA-NE | Not specified (Massachusetts law default) |
| FDAAGLA | Members present at a duly noticed meeting |
| XTUAANA | Similar to current SCUT (not specified) |
| SJTU-SV | Members present at a duly noticed meeting |
| TAAGNY | Not specified for member meeting |
| HCSSA | "Those members present" (no minimum) |
| OCA | 20 chapters (for National Convention) |

**Analysis:** HCSSA's "those present" quorum means even a small attendance can take binding organizational action. OCA's fixed "20 chapters" quorum sets a meaningful threshold for the Convention. Most California nonprofits use California law's default quorum rules when bylaws are silent. For a 501(c)(7), California law defaults to majority of voting members unless bylaws specify otherwise.

**Key Risk:** If quorum is not specified and defaults to majority of members, a poorly attended annual meeting may lack quorum and cannot transact business. Many organizations address this by setting a low fixed quorum or using the "those present" standard.

## Dimension 2: Voting Thresholds

### Routine Actions (Simple Majority)

All 10 organizations use simple majority (more than 50% of votes cast) for routine Board and membership decisions: approving budgets, electing Directors, adopting policies, etc.

### Supermajority Requirements

| Action | Threshold | Organizations |
|---|---|---|
| Bylaw amendments | 2/3 of Directors or 2/3 of members | Most organizations |
| Bylaw amendments | 3/4 of Board (emergency) | OCA |
| Charter revocation | 2/3 of Board | OCA |
| Director removal | 2/3 of remaining Directors | TAAGNY, PKUAA-NE |
| Honorary membership election | 2/3 of Board | TAAGNY, PKUAA-NE |
| Core article amendments | 2/3 + special notice + cooling-off period | USTCAF |
| Dissolution | 2/3 or 3/4 | Various |

**USTCAF Notable Practice:** Certain "core articles" (mission, membership criteria, amendment procedures themselves) are protected with extra layers: 2/3 vote + 30-day advance notice to members + 30-day cooling-off period before effective date. This prevents hasty changes to foundational governance.

**Analysis:** The consensus is 2/3 supermajority for bylaw amendments. Some organizations (PKUAA-NE) use two independent approval tracks: 2/3 Board OR majority of members. This provides flexibility — urgent amendments can be adopted by a Board supermajority without waiting for the annual membership meeting.

## Dimension 3: Action by Written Consent (Without a Meeting)

**Organizations with explicit authorization:** PKUAA-NE, USTCAF (implied), most mature nonprofits

**PKUAA-NE Approach:**
> "The Board may take action without a meeting if all Directors consent to the action in writing (including by email or electronic communication). Such actions shall be recorded in the minutes."

**Why It Matters:**
- Routine decisions (approving a vendor contract, filling a Board vacancy, ratifying a prior emergency action) do not require convening a full meeting
- For geographically distributed organizations, written consent reduces barriers to governance
- California Nonprofit Corporation Law (Corp. Code §7211) explicitly authorizes action by unanimous written consent for nonprofit mutual benefit corporations

**Pros:**
- Practical and efficient for routine decisions
- Reduces the burden of scheduling meetings for every governance action
- Creates a written record of the decision (the consent document)

**Cons:**
- "Unanimous written consent" means all Directors must consent — one Director can block action indefinitely
- Some decisions warrant deliberation and discussion, which a written consent process does not provide
- May create a culture of rubber-stamping if overused

**Recommendation:** Include an explicit action-by-written-consent provision, consistent with California law. For non-routine decisions (budget approval, officer elections), require an actual meeting.

## Dimension 4: Proxy Voting at Member Meetings

| Approach | Organizations | Key Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Explicitly prohibited** | FDAAGLA | No proxy voting; all votes must be in person |
| **Permitted (California law default)** | PUAASC, SJTU-SV | California Corp. Code permits proxy voting unless bylaws restrict |
| **Electronic pre-voting** | TAAGNY | Pre-votes cast electronically, confirmed at in-person meeting |
| **Not addressed** | XTUAANA, PKUAA-NE, CTUAAA | Defaults to applicable state law |

**FDAAGLA Notable Restriction:**
> "Proxy voting is not permitted at any meeting of FDAAGLA. All votes must be cast in person by the member present at the meeting."

**TAAGNY Electronic Pre-Voting:**
> "Electronic pre-voting is permitted, with in-person confirmation at the meeting. Each member may vote for up to the number of seats open for election."

**Pros of Allowing Proxy Voting:**
- Increases effective participation for members who cannot attend in person
- Particularly important for geographically distributed memberships (SCUT alumni span the country)
- Prevents "who showed up" from determining organizational direction

**Cons of Proxy Voting:**
- Proxy collection campaigns can become an organized power grab ("bring me 20 proxies from your friends")
- Difficult to verify that proxy holders are voting in accordance with the grantor's wishes
- Creates strategic dynamics that can be divisive in community organizations

**Pros of Prohibiting Proxy / Requiring In-Person:**
- Ensures voters are informed (they heard the speeches, saw the candidates)
- Prevents organized proxy campaigns
- Cleaner vote-counting process

**Alternative: Electronic/Absentee Voting:**
- TAAGNY's electronic pre-voting captures the benefits of both — participation without in-person attendance, but without proxy holder dynamics
- Requires a platform (email ballot, SurveyMonkey, etc.)

## Dimension 5: Runoff Elections

**Organizations with runoff provisions:** HCSSA, OCA

**HCSSA Approach:**
> Candidates for President/VP ticket must receive a majority (>50%) of votes. If no candidate receives a majority, a runoff between the top two tickets is held.

**OCA Approach:**
> Election requires majority of votes cast. If no candidate receives a majority, a runoff between top two candidates is held at the same convention session.

**Organizations without runoff:** Most others use plurality (highest vote total wins), which is simpler.

**Analysis:**
- **Majority with runoff:** Ensures the winner has genuine majority support; appropriate for major offices (President)
- **Plurality (simple highest vote):** Simpler; appropriate for multi-seat elections (e.g., electing 5 of 10 Board nominees)

**Recommendation:** For the President/Chairman election specifically, a majority requirement with a runoff (between top two candidates) ensures the winning president has broad member support. For other offices and Board elections, plurality is sufficient.

## Dimension 6: Decision-Making by Category

Most mature organizations implicitly or explicitly establish different decision-making rules by category:

| Category of Decision | Typical Threshold |
|---|---|
| Routine operational decisions | Simple majority of Board |
| Budget approval | Simple majority of Board |
| Officer elections (by Board) | Simple majority of Board |
| Director elections (by members) | Plurality or majority of members |
| Bylaw amendments | 2/3 of Board and/or members |
| Emergency bylaw amendments | 3/4 of full Board (OCA) |
| Director removal | 2/3 of remaining Directors |
| Dissolution | 2/3 or 3/4 (plus California law requirements) |
| Extraordinary transactions | 2/3 of Board (sale of assets, merger, etc.) |

## Recommendations for SCUT Alumni America

### Highest Priority

1. **Specify quorum for member meetings.** Do not rely on California law default. Options:
   - "Members present at a duly noticed meeting" (HCSSA/SJTU-SV model — low barrier)
   - A fixed minimum number (e.g., 10 members) — provides meaningful threshold
   - A percentage of members in good standing (e.g., 10%) — scales with membership

2. **Authorize action by written consent for routine Board decisions.** California law already permits this; explicitly authorizing it in the bylaws makes it clearly available and creates a proper process for recording such decisions.

3. **Decide on proxy voting vs. electronic voting.** Choose one or both:
   - Allow proxy voting with limits (e.g., no member may hold more than 5 proxies)
   - Authorize electronic/online voting as an alternative to in-person participation
   - Explicitly prohibit proxy voting (if in-person or electronic voting is sufficient)

### Secondary Considerations

4. **Implement majority + runoff for Chairman election.** This is a best practice that ensures the Chairman has genuine majority support. A plurality winner with only 30% of the vote may lack the mandate to lead effectively.

5. **Consider a dual-track amendment process.** Allow amendments by 2/3 Board vote (Board-only track) OR by a simple majority of members at the annual meeting (member track). This provides flexibility for urgent amendments while preserving member authority over foundational changes.

6. **Protect core governance provisions with extra procedural safeguards.** USTCAF's model of requiring extended notice and a cooling-off period for changes to mission, membership criteria, and amendment procedures themselves is worth adopting.
