# Policy Questions: Decision Process

These are the questions the organization must answer before drafting the decision process article of the revised By-Laws. Each question reflects a real policy choice rather than a legal requirement.

## 1. What should the quorum be for the annual membership meeting?

The current By-Laws define no quorum for membership meetings, meaning any number of members could theoretically conduct binding business. The organization should decide:
- Should quorum be a fixed number (e.g., 20 members) or a percentage of the current membership roll?
- A percentage-based quorum is more principled but requires a reliable, up-to-date membership roll — does the organization have the administrative capacity to maintain that?
- What happens if quorum is not reached at the annual meeting — is the meeting adjourned, or can it proceed for informational purposes only (with binding votes deferred to a subsequent meeting)?
- For the percentage approach: what percentage is appropriate? 10%? 20%? A higher percentage is more democratic but harder to achieve for a geographically dispersed membership.

## 2. Should members be able to vote by proxy?

The current By-Laws do not address proxy voting. The organization must decide:
- Should a member who cannot attend the annual meeting be allowed to designate another member to vote on their behalf?
- Should proxy votes be allowed for all decisions, or only for certain types of votes (e.g., officer elections but not routine motions)?
- Should the proxy have to be submitted in writing in advance of the meeting?
- Should there be a limit on how many proxies a single member can hold?
- Alternatively, if electronic voting is adopted (see Topic 03), proxy voting may be unnecessary — should the organization rely on asynchronous electronic voting instead?

## 3. Should the Board be able to take action by written consent without holding a meeting?

California law permits nonprofit boards to act by unanimous written consent without a meeting. This can be useful for routine matters between scheduled meetings.
- Should the By-Laws explicitly authorize written consent actions?
- Should written consent require unanimity, or a supermajority?
- Should written consent be limited to certain categories of decisions (e.g., administrative matters) while significant decisions always require a full meeting?
- How are written consents documented and archived?

---

## 4. Which decisions should require a supermajority, and what threshold?

Beyond By-Law amendments (currently requiring a two-thirds member vote), what other categories of decision should require more than a simple majority?
- Election or removal of the President / Chairman
- Expenditures above a certain dollar threshold
- Entering into contracts or partnerships
- Dissolution of the organization
- Changing the organization's name or principal office location
- Should these require a two-thirds majority, a three-fourths majority, or unanimous consent of the Board?

---

## 5. How should votes be cast and recorded at Board meetings?

The current By-Laws say nothing about the mechanics of voting at board meetings — whether by voice, show of hands, written ballot, or electronic poll.
- Should routine decisions be made by voice vote, with a show of hands called only when the chair is uncertain of the result?
- Should contested elections and sensitive matters (e.g., officer removal) use a secret ballot?
- When meetings are held virtually, what voting mechanism is acceptable (e.g., a chat message, a polling feature in the meeting platform, a separate form)?
- Must the minutes record each director's vote, or only the aggregate result?

---

## 6. What decisions are reserved for the full membership vs. the Board?

The current By-Laws only require membership votes for By-Law amendments. The organization should decide whether any additional matters should require membership approval:
- Major expenditures above a certain threshold (e.g., spending more than $10,000 on a single project)?
- Entering a formal partnership or affiliation agreement with another organization?
- Acquiring or disposing of significant organizational property?
- Changing the mission or purposes of the organization short of a full By-Laws amendment?
- If the membership vote is required, what is the threshold and quorum?

---

## 7. Who presides over a vote when the chair has a conflict of interest?

The current By-Laws designate the Chairman as the presiding officer at all meetings, but say nothing about what happens when the Chairman is personally interested in the outcome of a vote.
- Should the most senior available Vice Chairman automatically assume the chair when the Chairman recuses?
- Should the Board elect a temporary chair for the specific matter at hand?
- Should there be a standing rule that the presiding officer never participates in votes, with voting conducted by written ballot or poll when the chair has an interest?

---

## 8. How should tied votes be resolved?

The current By-Laws address ties only in the context of officer elections (resolved by lottery). The organization should decide:
- For Board decisions, does a tie mean the motion fails (status quo wins)?
- Or should the presiding officer have a casting vote to break ties?
- For membership meeting votes, how are ties handled?
- Should the By-Laws define a "tie" consistently — does an abstention count as a vote for tie-breaking purposes?
