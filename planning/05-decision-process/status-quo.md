# Status Quo: Decision Process

## What the Current By-Laws Say

**Article V §4 — Board Meetings**
- Quorum: majority of the authorized number of directors.
- Ordinary decisions: majority of directors present when quorum is met.
- Important matters (electing Chairman, Vice Chairmen, appointing Officers, and matters the Board designates as important): majority of all authorized directors required (not just those present).
- If directors leave mid-meeting, remaining directors may continue if at least a majority of quorum remains.
- Adjournment: majority of directors present may adjourn, even without quorum. If adjourned more than 24 hours, absent directors must be notified.

**Article VIII — Amendments**
- Requires a two-thirds majority vote of members present at the membership meeting.

**Article VI §2,3 — Officer Elections**
- Chairman and Vice Chairmen require majority of board votes; if no majority, top two go to runoff; tie broken by lottery.

## Gaps and Observations

- No quorum definition for membership meetings.
- No explicit rules for how votes are cast at Board or membership meetings (show of hands, secret ballot, etc.).
- No proxy voting rules (allowed or prohibited?).
- No written consent / action without a meeting provision.
- The distinction between "majority of authorized directors" and "majority of directors present" is stated but could be confused in practice.
- No rules for how electronic votes are counted in meetings held virtually.
- No appeal or challenge process for disputed votes.
- No rules for who chairs a vote when the Chairman has a conflict of interest.
