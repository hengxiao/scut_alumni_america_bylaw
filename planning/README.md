# Planning Directory

This directory contains the structured pre-drafting research and policy analysis used to inform the revision of the By-Laws of **South China University of Technology Alumni, America**.

Each subdirectory covers one topic area of the By-Laws. The work here is meant to be completed **before** the drafting committee writes any new By-Laws language. The goal is to make sure that every policy choice is deliberate and well-documented.

## File Types

Each topic directory contains the same three files:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `definition.md` | Explains what this topic area covers and why it matters to the By-Laws. Read this first to understand the scope of the topic. |
| `status-quo.md` | Summarizes what the **current By-Laws** (adopted December 2002) say about this topic, including any gaps or weaknesses identified by the drafting committee. |
| `policy-questions.md` | Lists the concrete decisions the organization must make before the new By-Laws can be drafted. Each question represents a real policy choice, not a legal requirement. The drafting committee should work through these questions with the board before writing any new language. |
