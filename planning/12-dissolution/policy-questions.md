# Policy Questions: Dissolution

These are the questions the organization must answer before drafting the dissolution article of the revised By-Laws. Each question reflects a real policy choice rather than a legal requirement (though some options are constrained by California law and IRS rules).

## 1. Under what circumstances may dissolution be initiated?

The current By-Laws say nothing about dissolving the organization. Before a process can be designed, the organization should decide:
- Should dissolution be possible only in extreme circumstances (e.g., the organization has become inactive for a defined period, all attempts to recruit leadership have failed, or the organization's debts exceed its assets)?
- Or should dissolution be treated as an ordinary governance decision that can be made by the membership at any time, for any reason?
- Should there be a waiting period or a "winding down" phase before dissolution is finalized — for example, a requirement to first attempt to recruit new leadership before voting to dissolve?

---

## 2. Who has authority to initiate a dissolution vote?

- Should dissolution require a petition from a minimum number of members or directors before it can be put to a vote?
- Should it be initiateable by the Board alone, or must it come from the membership?
- Should any officer be able to propose dissolution to the Board, or must it come as a collective proposal from a specified number of directors?

## 3. What vote is required to approve dissolution?

This is a significant policy question: a dissolution decision is irreversible and should require a high threshold.
- Should dissolution require a two-thirds supermajority of the full membership (not just those present at a meeting)?
- Or is a two-thirds vote of members present at a duly noticed membership meeting sufficient?
- Should the Board vote also be required — for example, approval by two-thirds of the full Board followed by a membership vote?
- Should the notice requirements for a dissolution vote be more stringent than for ordinary amendments (e.g., 60 days' notice rather than 30)?

## 4. How should outstanding liabilities be settled before distribution of remaining assets?

Upon dissolution, the organization must pay its debts before distributing any remaining assets.
- Who is responsible for identifying and paying all outstanding obligations — the Treasurer, the Board, or a specially appointed liquidating committee?
- Should there be a required waiting period after announcing dissolution to allow creditors to come forward before final distribution?
- What happens if the organization's liabilities exceed its assets at the time of dissolution — who is responsible for any shortfall, and how should the By-Laws address this risk?

---

## 5. To whom should remaining assets be distributed upon dissolution?

This is both a values decision and a legal constraint: California law and IRS 501(c)(7) rules prohibit distributing assets to members for their private benefit.
- Should remaining assets be transferred to another SCUT alumni organization (e.g., a regional chapter or a national alumni association, if one exists)?
- Should assets be donated to SCUT directly (the university in China), if legally permissible?
- Should assets be donated to another 501(c)(7) or 501(c)(3) organization with a related mission (e.g., a Chinese-American community foundation or scholarship fund)?
- Should the By-Laws name a specific organization as the designated recipient, or give the Board discretion to select a recipient at the time of dissolution, subject to defined criteria?
- If the named recipient no longer exists at the time of dissolution, what is the fallback?

## 6. What notifications are required upon dissolution?

A dissolving California nonprofit corporation has obligations to notify regulators and the public.
- Should the By-Laws explicitly assign responsibility for filing the dissolution paperwork with the California Secretary of State?
- Should there be a requirement to notify the IRS of the dissolution and file a final Form 990?
- Should members receive formal written notice of the dissolution decision, including information about how assets will be distributed?
- Should creditors and vendors receive notice, and if so, how?

---

## 7. Should there be a process for reorganization or merger as an alternative to dissolution?

Dissolution is not the only way to end the organization's current form. The organization may wish to address related scenarios:
- If a national SCUT alumni association is formed in the future, should there be a process for this organization to merge into it rather than dissolving?
- Should the By-Laws address the possibility of spinning off a regional chapter or creating a successor organization?
- Should a reorganization require the same vote threshold as dissolution, or a different one?
