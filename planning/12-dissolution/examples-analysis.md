## How the 10 Reference Organizations Handle Dissolution

### Overview

Dissolution provisions are legally and practically critical for any nonprofit organization. They specify (a) what process must be followed to dissolve the organization and (b) where the remaining assets go after all debts are paid. The reference organizations divide sharply on this issue: most well-governed organizations have detailed dissolution provisions; a significant gap exists in the XTUAANA model (which mirrors SCUT Alumni America's current state).

| Organization | Has Dissolution Provision | Asset Distribution Target | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| PUAASC | **Yes** | 501(c)(3) organizations serving Chinese-American community | Preference for community benefit |
| PKUAA-NE | **Yes** | 501(c)(3) educational/charitable organizations | Standard 501(c)(3) dissolution language |
| USTCAF | **Yes** | Educational and charitable purposes consistent with USTC mission | 501(c)(3) requirement |
| FDAAGLA | **Yes** | Charitable organizations | Standard language |
| XTUAANA | **Missing** | N/A | Critical gap — same template as SCUT |
| CTUAAA | Not clear | Not specified | National federation — complex |
| SJTU-SV | **Yes** | 501(c)(3) organizations | Standard |
| HCSSA | N/A | Harvard University or 501(c)(3) | Student org context |
| TAAGNY | **Yes** | 501(c)(3) orgs serving educational/cultural exchange, US-China | Preferred direction |
| OCA | **Yes** | 501(c)(3) orgs serving AAPI community or civil rights | Mission-aligned preference |

**Critical Finding:** XTUAANA (the organization most similar in template to SCUT Alumni America) **does not have a dissolution clause** — the same gap that likely exists in SCUT Alumni America's current bylaws. This is identified as a **critical legal gap** by the XTUAANA analysis.

## Why a Dissolution Clause Is Essential

### Legal Requirements

**California Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation Law (Corp. Code §8716–§8717):**
When a mutual benefit corporation dissolves:
1. The corporation must file a certificate of dissolution with the California Secretary of State
2. All debts and liabilities must be paid or provided for
3. Remaining assets are distributed **as specified in the bylaws or articles**
4. If the bylaws/articles are silent, the default for a mutual benefit corporation is distribution **to the members** (i.e., the assets are divided among the members)

**Why the Default Is Problematic:**
For SCUT Alumni America, distributing remaining assets to members upon dissolution would mean:
- Each member receives a small cash payment
- This may trigger taxable income for members
- It betrays the organizational purpose (why should members receive the scholarship fund or event deposits as personal income?)
- For an organization that has received any charitable donations, distribution to members may be inconsistent with donor expectations
- If the organization ever holds real property or significant assets, member distribution creates administrative complexity

**Solution:** A dissolution clause that specifies distribution to one or more charitable or educational organizations prevents the problematic default outcome and aligns the organization's ultimate fate with its mission.

## Model 1: Standard 501(c)(3) Dissolution Language

**Organizations:** PKUAA-NE, SJTU-SV, USTCAF, TAAGNY, OCA

**Description:** Assets go to one or more 501(c)(3) organizations as determined by the Board. This language is required for 501(c)(3) organizations and is best practice for 501(c)(7)s as well.

**Standard Language (PKUAA-NE / SJTU-SV type):**
> "Upon dissolution of the Association, and after payment or provision for all debts and liabilities, all remaining assets shall be distributed exclusively to one or more organizations that qualify as tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, as selected by the Board of Directors."

**TAAGNY Preferred Direction:**
> "...with preference for organizations serving educational or cultural exchange purposes related to China and the United States."

**OCA Mission-Aligned Preference:**
> "...with preference for organizations serving the AAPI community or civil rights purposes, as determined by the Board."

**Pros:**
- Legally clear; satisfies California law and any future IRS compliance requirements
- Assets remain in the nonprofit sector (not distributed to members)
- Board has discretion to select recipient organization appropriate at time of dissolution
- The "preference" language allows mission alignment without legally binding the organization to a specific recipient that may no longer exist

**Cons:**
- Does not specify the recipient organization by name — what if the Board cannot agree?
- Does not address whether former members have any say in the dissolution decision
- The Board composition at time of dissolution may not reflect current member values

## Model 2: Mission-Specific Preferred Recipients

**Organizations:** PUAASC, TAAGNY, OCA

**Description:** In addition to the standard 501(c)(3) distribution requirement, the bylaws express a preference for organizations serving a specific community or mission — without legally mandating a specific recipient.

**PUAASC Language:**
> "...with preference given to organizations serving the Chinese-American community."

**TAAGNY Language:**
> "...with preference for organizations serving educational or cultural exchange purposes related to China and the United States."

**OCA Language:**
> "...with preference for organizations serving the AAPI community or civil rights purposes."

**Pros:**
- Aligns the dissolution outcome with the organization's mission (assets for SCUT alumni / Chinese American community purposes)
- Provides guidance to the final Board without legally binding them to a recipient that might not exist
- Signals to members that the organization's resources will stay within its intended community
- "Preference" is not legally mandatory — provides flexibility if preferred organizations don't exist

**Cons:**
- "Preference" is advisory, not binding — the final Board could deviate if circumstances warrant
- May create member expectations that are difficult to manage if the actual dissolution differs from expressed preferences

---

## Model 3: Name a Specific Recipient Organization

**Not used by any reference organization** — and deliberately so.

**Description:** The bylaws name a specific organization (e.g., "SCUT's Alumni Foundation" or "United Way") to receive assets upon dissolution.

**Why Reference Organizations Don't Use This:**
- The named organization might not exist at time of dissolution (decades in the future)
- The named organization might change its mission or become defunct
- Legal complications arise if the named recipient cannot receive the assets
- Creates unnecessary rigidity

**Recommendation:** Do not name a specific recipient. Use the "preference" language model instead.

## Dissolution Process: Who Decides and How?

| Organization | Dissolution Authority |
|---|---|
| PUAASC | Board of Directors (per California law) |
| PKUAA-NE | Board of Directors (per Massachusetts law) |
| TAAGNY | Board of Directors |
| OCA | Board of Directors |
| SJTU-SV | Board of Directors |

**California Law Process for Mutual Benefit Corporations (Corp. Code §8610 et seq.):**
1. **Voluntary dissolution** requires either:
   - Board vote to dissolve, followed by member ratification (if required by bylaws), OR
   - Member vote to dissolve (majority or supermajority, as bylaws specify)
2. File **Certificate of Dissolution** with California Secretary of State
3. Wind up affairs: pay debts, collect receivables, liquidate assets
4. Distribute remaining assets per bylaws
5. File final tax returns (IRS Form 990 + California Form 199)

**Recommendation:** The bylaws should specify that dissolution requires at minimum:
- 2/3 vote of the Board of Directors, AND
- Majority vote of the members at a duly noticed member meeting

This two-step process (Board + member approval) ensures that dissolution is not undertaken unilaterally by the Board.

---

## What Counts as "Debts and Liabilities" (Paid Before Distribution)

All dissolution provisions specify that assets are distributed only **after** paying all debts and liabilities. This includes:
- Any outstanding vendor invoices or contracts
- Member dues refunds (if the bylaws promise refunds upon dissolution — most don't)
- Lease obligations
- Any government fees or tax liabilities
- Claims arising from pending litigation

For SCUT Alumni America (likely minimal assets and liabilities), dissolution will almost certainly result in a small remaining balance after clearing any open obligations.

## Comparative Summary

| Provision Element | Best Practice | SCUT (Current) | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Has dissolution clause | All major orgs | **Missing** | **Critical** |
| Distribution to 501(c)(3)s | Universal | Missing | Critical |
| Mission-aligned preference | PUAASC, TAAGNY, OCA | Missing | Recommended |
| Dissolution process (2/3 vote) | PKUAA-NE, TAAGNY | Missing | Important |
| Wind-up procedures | Referenced | Missing | Should add |

## Recommendations for SCUT Alumni America

### Critical (Legal Gap — Must Address)

1. **Add a dissolution clause to the bylaws.** This is the single most important legal gap. Without it, California law defaults to member distribution upon dissolution, which is almost certainly not the organization's intent.

2. **Specify that remaining assets go to 501(c)(3) organizations.** Use the standard language modeled after PUAASC:
> "Upon dissolution of this Association, after payment of all debts and liabilities, all remaining assets shall be distributed to one or more organizations qualifying as tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, with preference for organizations serving the SCUT alumni community or Chinese-American educational and cultural purposes, as selected by the Board of Directors."

3. **Specify the dissolution vote threshold.** Recommend: 2/3 of the Board of Directors AND majority vote of members at a duly noticed special meeting. This prevents a rogue Board from dissolving the organization without member input.
