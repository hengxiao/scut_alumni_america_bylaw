# Status Quo: Dissolution

## What the Current By-Laws Say

The current By-Laws contain no dissolution provisions.

**Closest relevant language:**
- Article III §2: States that the organization is not organized for profit and no assets shall inure to the benefit of any member. This is relevant to dissolution but does not constitute a dissolution clause.

## Gaps and Observations

- No process for initiating dissolution.
- No vote threshold required to dissolve the organization.
- No rules for settling outstanding liabilities before distributing assets.
- No designated recipient for remaining assets upon dissolution.
- California law (Corp. Code §8710 et seq.) provides default dissolution procedures for nonprofit mutual benefit corporations, but the By-Laws should explicitly address this to avoid ambiguity.
- The absence of a dissolution clause may complicate asset distribution and could allow remaining assets to be distributed improperly.
