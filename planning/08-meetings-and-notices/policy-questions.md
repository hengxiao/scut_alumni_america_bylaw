# Policy Questions: Meetings and Notices

These are the questions the organization must answer before drafting the meetings and notices article of the revised By-Laws. Each question reflects a real policy choice rather than a legal requirement.

## 1. How many regular Board meetings should be required per year?

The current By-Laws require only one Board meeting per year, which is very infrequent for an active organization.
- Should the minimum number of regular Board meetings be increased to four (quarterly) or twelve (monthly)?
- Should the By-Laws distinguish between in-person/formal Board meetings and shorter virtual check-in meetings that may not require the same procedural formality?
- What happens if the Board fails to hold the required number of meetings in a year — should there be a consequence, or is this simply a guideline?

## 2. Should virtual and hybrid meetings be explicitly authorized?

The current By-Laws make no mention of virtual or remote meetings, leaving the organization's practices on shaky legal footing.
- Should the By-Laws explicitly authorize fully virtual Board meetings (e.g., via Zoom or another video platform)?
- Should the By-Laws authorize hybrid meetings where some participants attend in person and others join remotely?
- Should virtual participation count equally toward quorum and voting?
- Should the By-Laws specify which platforms are acceptable for virtual meetings, or simply state that any platform providing real-time audio and video communication is acceptable?
- Should any category of meeting — such as the annual membership meeting — be required to have an in-person option available, even if most participants join virtually?

## 3. What should the advance notice period be?

The current one-week notice period is short for a geographically dispersed membership.
- Should the notice period for the annual membership meeting be extended to at least 30 days?
- Should Board meetings require more notice than the current one week — for example, two weeks for regular meetings and 48 hours for special/emergency meetings?
- Should different notice periods apply to virtual meetings vs. in-person meetings (since virtual meetings require less travel planning)?

## 4. What must a meeting notice include?

The current By-Laws require notice to state the "purpose, date, and place" but nothing else.
- Should a preliminary agenda be required as part of the notice?
- Should the notice include a dial-in link or video conference information when a virtual option is available?
- For the annual membership meeting, should the notice include the candidates for election, so members can research them before voting?
- Should supporting materials (financial reports, proposed By-Law amendments) be distributed with the meeting notice rather than only presented at the meeting?

---

## 5. Through what channels should notices be sent?

The current By-Laws authorize notice "in writing or by email" — a very narrow list given modern communication practices.
- Should notice via WeChat (the primary channel the community likely uses) be formally authorized?
- Should posting on the organization's official website count as notice, and if so, does it substitute for direct individual notice or only supplement it?
- Should the organization maintain a communication platform (e.g., a mailing list or group chat) that is considered the official notice channel, so that members who fail to join it cannot later claim they did not receive notice?
- Should there be a fallback — if an email or message is undelivered, what additional steps must the Secretary take?

---

## 6. Should there be a defined agenda process?

The current By-Laws have no agenda rules at all.
- Should a draft agenda be distributed a set number of days before each Board meeting and membership meeting?
- Should members be able to submit agenda items in advance, and if so, how far in advance and to whom?
- Should the presiding officer have authority to rule items out of order if they were not included in the notice or agenda?
- Should the agenda include time estimates for each item to help meetings run efficiently?

---

## 7. What records must be kept from each meeting, and who is responsible?

The current By-Laws require only that Board meeting summaries be "accessible to members." There are no rules for membership meeting minutes.
- Should full minutes be taken at every Board meeting and annual membership meeting?
- Should minutes be approved at the following meeting before being considered official?
- Who takes minutes at the membership meeting — the Secretary, or a designated note-taker when the Secretary is occupied with facilitating?
- Should minutes be posted on the organization's website, sent to all members, or made available only on request?
- How long must meeting minutes be retained?

---

## 8. What should happen when a meeting cannot reach quorum?

The current By-Laws address adjournment and reconvening for Board meetings but not for membership meetings.
- If a membership meeting fails to reach quorum, should it be automatically adjourned to a later date (e.g., two weeks later) where any number of attending members constitutes quorum?
- Should repeatedly failing to achieve quorum trigger a review of whether the quorum threshold is realistic?
- Should members who attend a failed-quorum meeting receive credit for their participation (e.g., for purposes of tracking engagement or avoiding automatic resignation rules)?

---

## 9. Should the annual membership meeting have a fixed schedule?

The current By-Laws say the annual meeting is held "once a year" with no fixed timing.
- Should the By-Laws specify a target time of year for the annual meeting (e.g., "during the first quarter of each calendar year" or "within 60 days of the close of the fiscal year")?
- Should the annual meeting be coordinated with a popular community event (e.g., a Lunar New Year gathering or an annual banquet) to maximize attendance?
- If the annual meeting cannot be held within the specified window, what is the process for scheduling it late, and who approves the change?
