## How the 10 Reference Organizations Handle Meetings and Notices

### Overview of Key Dimensions

| Dimension | Range Across Examples |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Board meetings per year | 1 minimum (SCUT current) to 4 minimum (FDAAGLA, SJTU-SV, TAAGNY) |
| Board meeting notice | 7 days (most) to 30 days (CTUAAA) |
| Annual member meeting notice | 5 days (HCSSA) to 60 days (OCA Convention) |
| Virtual/video meetings | Not mentioned (PUAASC, XTUAANA) to explicitly authorized (FDAAGLA, SJTU-SV, TAAGNY, OCA) |
| Special meeting triggers | Board + President (most) to member petition (15% TAAGNY, 20% PKUAA-NE) |
| Quorum for member meeting | "Those present" (HCSSA) to 20 chapters (OCA) |

---

## Dimension 1: Board Meeting Frequency

This is one of the most significant governance gaps identified across the example organizations. The number of Board meetings per year directly affects governance quality.

| Organization | Board Meetings / Year (Minimum) |
|---|---|
| PUAASC | 2 meetings minimum |
| PKUAA-NE | Not specified (California 501(c)(3) best practice: quarterly) |
| USTCAF | General Board: as needed; EC: more frequent |
| FDAAGLA | **4 meetings minimum** |
| XTUAANA | 1 meeting minimum (same as current SCUT) |
| CTUAAA | Not specified |
| SJTU-SV | **4 meetings minimum** |
| HCSSA | Executive Board: monthly during academic year |
| TAAGNY | **4 meetings minimum** |
| OCA | **3 meetings minimum** |

**Analysis: The "4 Meetings per Year" Consensus**

The most mature alumni organizations (TAAGNY, SJTU-SV, FDAAGLA — all established, well-governed associations) uniformly require at least **4 Board meetings per year** (quarterly). This is consistent with best practices for nonprofit governance.

**Why 4 Meetings Matter:**
- Quarterly meetings align with natural planning cycles (spring events, summer planning, fall activities, year-end review)
- Each meeting provides a dedicated opportunity for financial review, event planning, and strategic discussion
- With only 1 meeting per year (current SCUT practice), the Board functions as a formality rather than a governance body
- Board members who meet only once per year are rarely informed enough to provide meaningful oversight

**HCSSA (Monthly Meetings):**
> "The Executive Board shall meet at least monthly during the academic year." — This high frequency is appropriate for a student organization with an active event calendar, but may be excessive for an alumni association without staff.

**OCA (3 Meetings per Year):**
> Board meets at least 3 times per year — a reasonable minimum for a national organization where in-person meetings require travel.

**Recommendation:** Set a minimum of **4 Board meetings per year** (quarterly). This is the clear consensus for well-governed organizations of SCUT Alumni America's profile.

## Dimension 2: Board Meeting Notice Requirements

| Organization | Board Meeting Notice |
|---|---|
| PUAASC | 14 days |
| PKUAA-NE | 7 days |
| TAAGNY | 7 days |
| SJTU-SV | 7 days |
| OCA | 14 days |
| CTUAAA | 30 days |
| FDAAGLA | 7 days (implied) |
| XTUAANA | Not specified |
| HCSSA | 5 days |

**Analysis:**

**7 days** is the most common Board meeting notice period in this sample. It provides Directors with a week to prepare, arrange attendance, and review any pre-meeting materials. California law's minimum (48 hours by email, 4 days by mail) is far lower, but 7 days is the appropriate standard for a volunteer organization.

**14 days** (PUAASC, OCA) provides more lead time, which is appropriate for organizations where Directors have demanding day jobs and need more notice to clear their calendars.

**30 days** (CTUAAA) is unusually long for Board meetings — appropriate for conventions or events requiring travel, but excessive for routine Board meetings.

**Recommendation:** **7 days** advance notice for Board meetings; **14 days** for special meetings where significant matters (budget, bylaw amendments) will be voted on.

## Dimension 3: Annual Member Meeting Notice

| Organization | Annual Meeting Notice |
|---|---|
| PUAASC | Not specified |
| PKUAA-NE | 21 days |
| FDAAGLA | 30 days |
| TAAGNY | 21 days |
| SJTU-SV | Not specified |
| XTUAANA | 30 days (current) |
| OCA | 60 days (Convention) |
| HCSSA | 5 days (general meetings) |

**Analysis:**

**21–30 days** is the consensus range for annual member meeting notice. SCUT Alumni America's current 30-day notice is actually consistent with best practices. The 60-day notice required by OCA is specific to its large national convention (50+ chapters, delegate elections, travel planning required) and is not appropriate for a local or regional alumni association.

**California Law Context:** California Nonprofit Corporation Law requires at least:
- 10 days' notice for routine annual meetings
- 20 days' notice for meetings where significant member actions (amendments, dissolution) will be considered

**30 days** (SCUT's current practice) already exceeds both minimums, which is appropriate.

## Dimension 4: Virtual and Electronic Meeting Participation

This is one of the most practically important provisions for a geographically distributed organization like SCUT Alumni America.

| Organization | Virtual Meeting Authorization |
|---|---|
| PUAASC | Not mentioned |
| PKUAA-NE | Electronic participation referenced in consent provisions |
| FDAAGLA | **Explicitly authorized: "meetings may be conducted via video conference"** |
| XTUAANA | Not mentioned |
| CTUAAA | Not specified |
| SJTU-SV | **Explicitly authorized: video conference equivalent to in-person** |
| HCSSA | Email notices; electronic participation implied |
| TAAGNY | **Explicitly authorized: "Meetings may be held by video conference"** |
| OCA | **Explicitly authorized for Board meetings** |

**FDAAGLA Best Practice Language:**
> "Meetings of the Board of Directors may be conducted via video conference or other electronic means, with the same legal effect as in-person meetings, provided that all participants can hear each other simultaneously."

**TAAGNY Language:**
> "Meetings may be held by video conference."

**Analysis:**

Four of the 10 organizations explicitly authorize video conference meetings. This provision is critical for SCUT Alumni America because:
1. Bay Area members may be spread across the South Bay, East Bay, Peninsula, San Francisco, etc.
2. Board members with full-time jobs and families cannot always attend in-person evening meetings
3. COVID-19 demonstrated that video conference meetings can be just as effective as in-person for governance purposes
4. California law (Corp. Code §7211) explicitly permits board meetings via video conference when bylaws authorize it

**Recommendation:** Add an explicit video conference authorization for both Board meetings and member meetings. Specify the technical requirement (all participants must be able to hear each other simultaneously — the California law standard).

## Dimension 5: Special Meetings

### Who Can Call Special Meetings?

| Organization | Special Board Meeting Trigger |
|---|---|
| PUAASC | President or majority of Directors |
| PKUAA-NE | President or any 3 Directors |
| TAAGNY | President or any 5 Directors |
| SJTU-SV | President or any 3 Directors |
| OCA | President or any 5 Directors |
| FDAAGLA | President or 3 Directors |
| XTUAANA | Not specified |

**Consensus:** President OR a small group of Directors (3–5) can call a special Board meeting. This prevents the President from blocking urgently needed meetings.

### Member-Initiated Special Meetings

This is a significant democratic check that several organizations provide:

| Organization | Member Petition for Special Meeting |
|---|---|
| TAAGNY | 15% of regular members in good standing |
| PKUAA-NE | 20% of regular members in good standing |
| PUAASC | Not provided |
| SJTU-SV | Not provided |
| XTUAANA | Not provided |

**Why Member Petition Rights Matter:**
If the Board becomes unresponsive to member concerns — or if members believe the Board has taken an action requiring member oversight — a petition mechanism gives members a meaningful democratic remedy without requiring a lawsuit.

**TAAGNY's 15% threshold:** For an organization of 100 members, this means 15 signatures. This is achievable but not trivially easy, striking the right balance.

**Recommendation:** Add a member petition mechanism allowing 10–15% of members in good standing to request a special membership meeting.

## Dimension 6: Notice Method and Documentation

| Organization | Notice Method | Documentation Required |
|---|---|---|
| PUAASC | Written notice (mail or email) | Waiver of notice for emergency |
| PKUAA-NE | Email or other electronic notice acceptable | Action by written consent documented |
| TAAGNY | Notice at least 7 days in advance | — |
| SJTU-SV | Email | Minutes required |
| OCA | Specified in advance by method | Minutes required |
| HCSSA | "Email or other electronic communication" | Minutes required |

**Consensus:** Email is universally accepted as a valid notice method. No organization in this sample requires physical mail as the primary (or only) means of notice.

**HCSSA Language (Modern):**
> "Notice of general meetings shall be provided to all members at least five (5) days in advance by email or other electronic communication."

**Recommendation:** Explicitly state that notices may be provided by email or through the organization's official digital channels (WeChat, website, etc.). Physical mail should not be required as the primary notice method.

---

## Dimension 7: Waiver of Notice

All well-drafted bylaws include a waiver of notice provision — a Director or member who attends a meeting waives their right to notice of that meeting (unless they attend solely to object to the lack of notice).

| Organization | Waiver of Notice |
|---|---|
| PUAASC | Included |
| PKUAA-NE | Included |
| TAAGNY | Implied |
| SJTU-SV | Not specified |
| XTUAANA | Not specified |

**Recommendation:** Include a brief waiver-of-notice provision. Standard language:
> "Attendance at any meeting constitutes a waiver of notice, unless the person attends solely to object to the meeting being held without proper notice."

## Comparative Summary

| Governance Feature | Peer Best Practice | SCUT Alumni America (Current) | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Board meeting frequency | 4/year (quarterly) | 1/year minimum | **Significant** |
| Board meeting notice | 7 days | Not specified | **Needs specification** |
| Annual meeting notice | 21–30 days | 30 days | Adequate |
| Virtual meeting authorization | Explicitly authorized | Not mentioned | **Missing** |
| Special meeting trigger | President or 3–5 Directors | Not specified | **Needs specification** |
| Member petition for special meeting | 10–15% of members | Not provided | Consider adding |
| Email notice | Explicitly permitted | Not addressed | **Add explicitly** |

---

## Recommendations for SCUT Alumni America

### Critical

1. **Set Board meeting minimum at 4 per year (quarterly).** This is the most important governance improvement. One meeting per year is insufficient for meaningful governance. Quarterly meetings create a regular governance rhythm.

2. **Explicitly authorize video conference participation** for both Board and member meetings. California law permits this when bylaws authorize it.

### High Priority

3. **Specify Board meeting notice period (7 days)** and annual meeting notice period (30 days — maintain current). Specify that email is an acceptable (and primary) notice method.

4. **Specify who can call special meetings.** President OR any 3 Directors for Board meetings; President OR Board majority for special member meetings.

### Medium Priority

5. **Add a member petition mechanism** for special membership meetings (10–15% threshold).

6. **Add a waiver-of-notice provision.**

7. **Require written minutes for all Board and member meetings**, with minutes approved at the next meeting and maintained as permanent organizational records.
