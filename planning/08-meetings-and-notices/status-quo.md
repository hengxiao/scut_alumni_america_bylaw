- Notice period of one week is short for members and directors who may be geographically dispersed.
- Notice channels limited to writing and email; no mention of messaging apps or website announcements.
- No quorum defined for membership meetings.
- No agenda process or requirement to share an agenda in advance.
- No rules for how meetings are recorded or who takes minutes at membership meetings.
- Only one regular Board meeting per year is the minimum — very infrequent for an active organization.
- No rules for what happens if a meeting cannot reach quorum.
