# Examples Analysis: Vision and Purpose

**Planning Topic:** 01 — Vision and Purpose
**Question:** What should be the stated mission, purposes, and scope of SCUT Alumni America?

## How the 10 Reference Organizations Handle Vision and Purpose

### Overview of Approaches

The 10 reference organizations fall into three broad models for articulating vision and purpose:

| Model | Organizations | Core Characteristic |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Fellowship-first** | PUAASC, FDAAGLA, XTUAANA, TAAGNY | Alumni bonding, university connection, mutual support as primary purpose |
| **Fellowship + Service/Advocacy** | PKUAA-NE, SJTU-SV, OCA | Adds community service, professional development, civic engagement |
| **Foundation/Charitable** | USTCAF, CTUAAA | Scholarship and charitable giving as organizational centerpiece |

## Model 1: Fellowship-First Alumni Association

**Organizations:** PUAASC, FDAAGLA, XTUAANA, TAAGNY

**Description:** The stated purposes center on (a) connecting alumni to each other, (b) supporting the home university's reputation and mission, and (c) cultural exchange between Chinese and American communities.

**Example Language (TAAGNY):**
> "To connect and serve Tsinghua University alumni residing or working in the greater New York metropolitan area; to foster fellowship, mutual support, and professional collaboration among members; to promote the educational and cultural legacy of Tsinghua University in the New York region; to facilitate cultural exchange and mutual understanding between the United States and China."

**Example Language (FDAAGLA):**
> Three tiers of purpose: fellowship and networking among Fudan alumni; promoting Fudan's academic prestige and supporting its development in the US; and serving as a bridge for Sino-American cultural exchange.

**Pros:**
- Straightforward and unambiguous scope — easy to communicate to members and alumni
- Appropriate for IRS 501(c)(7) status (social and recreational purposes for members)
- Avoids mission drift; the organization stays focused on its core constituency
- Low controversy — members join an alumni association for fellowship, not advocacy

**Cons:**
- Narrow scope limits public benefit framing and prevents future conversion to 501(c)(3)
- Does not explicitly address the needs of newly arrived alumni (a key service SCUT Alumni America provides in practice)
- No explicit mention of career development or professional networking, which are major reasons members participate
- Bay Area SCUT alumni may want broader civic/professional engagement language

## Model 2: Fellowship + Professional Development + Community Service

**Organizations:** PKUAA-NE, SJTU-SV

**Description:** Adds explicit professional development, career networking, and community service purposes alongside the core fellowship mission. Frames the organization as contributing to both its members and the broader community.

**Example Language (SJTU-SV):**
> "(a) To promote fellowship, mutual assistance, and cultural exchange among SJTU alumni; (b) To foster professional networking and career development opportunities; (c) To support SJTU's academic mission and maintain ties to the university; (d) To contribute to the broader community through service and engagement; (e) To serve as a bridge between Chinese and American communities in the Bay Area."

**Example Language (PKUAA-NE):**
> Adds community engagement, civic participation, and cultural programming to the standard alumni fellowship purposes; frames these as charitable/educational activities consistent with 501(c)(3) status.

**Pros:**
- Reflects what members actually use the organization for (professional networking is consistently cited)
- Explicitly includes newcomer support — critical for an active service population
- Broadens appeal to young alumni and students who prioritize career development
- Opens a pathway to 501(c)(3) conversion if the organization chooses to pursue it
- Community service language qualifies for some grant funding and corporate sponsorships

**Cons:**
- Broader purpose statement requires broader operational capacity — creating expectations the organization must meet
- Community service and civic engagement language may invite political controversies if not carefully managed
- 501(c)(7) organizations must ensure that community service activities do not exceed the 35% non-member-benefit threshold

## Model 3: Foundation / Scholarship-Centered

**Organizations:** USTCAF, CTUAAA (via its foundation arm)

**Description:** The organization's stated purpose is explicitly charitable — raising and distributing funds for scholarships, educational exchange, and student support. Fellowship is secondary.

**Example Language (USTCAF):**
> "To support and promote the educational and research mission of the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) through scholarships, fellowships, and educational programs; to foster academic and cultural exchange between China and the United States; to provide financial support to USTC students and researchers."

**Example Language (CTUAAA):**
> CTUAAA operates a separate foundation (CTUAFA — Chiao Tung University Alumni Foundation of America) dedicated to scholarships, while the main organization handles fellowship and coordination.

**Pros:**
- Very clear charitable mission; ideal for 501(c)(3) status and tax-deductible donations
- Scholarship programs generate strong alumni engagement and donor pride
- Separating foundation from fellowship preserves each entity's focus
- Explicit financial benefit to students and the university creates tangible value

**Cons:**
- Requires significant financial infrastructure (endowment, scholarship selection process, IRS reporting for 501(c)(3))
- Fellowship and social activities may feel secondary or under-resourced
- Dual-entity model (fellowship org + foundation) creates governance complexity
- Not appropriate if the organization wishes to remain 501(c)(7)

## Model 4: Advocacy and Civil Rights (OCA Only)

**Organizations:** OCA — Asian Pacific American Advocates

**Description:** Entirely different model — OCA is a civil rights and advocacy organization serving all AAPIs, not university alumni. Mission focuses on political representation, discrimination, civic education.

**Relevance to SCUT Alumni America:** This model is NOT directly applicable. However, OCA demonstrates that a Chinese-American organization with humble origins (112 delegates in 1973) can build a sustained national institution with a powerful public mission. If SCUT Alumni America ever wished to address broader AAPI community issues, OCA's mission language provides inspiration.

**Key Takeaway:** OCA's non-partisan clause ("shall not endorse, support, or oppose any candidate for political office, but may engage in civic education") is a best-practice template for any organization that wants to engage in community issues while protecting its non-partisan character.

## Recommendations for SCUT Alumni America

### Immediate Considerations

1. **Add explicit newcomer/new-arrival support to the purpose statement.** TAAGNY's bylaws ("to assist newly arrived Tsinghua alumni and students in their transition to life in New York") explicitly name what SCUT Alumni America already does in practice. Naming it in the bylaws validates this service and creates organizational commitment to continue it.

2. **Add professional networking/career development as an explicit purpose.** SJTU-SV's model (Bay Area, similar constituency) explicitly includes this. It reflects member expectations and is consistent with 501(c)(7) purposes as long as activities primarily benefit members.

3. **Consider whether to add community service language.** If SCUT Alumni America wants to pursue future 501(c)(3) conversion, adding community service and cultural exchange language now creates a foundation. If remaining 501(c)(7), keep the language primarily member-focused.

4. **Geographic scope clarification.** TAAGNY explicitly limits its Regular membership to the Greater New York area. SCUT Alumni America's bylaws should clarify whether its scope is all of America or the San Francisco Bay Area — or whether both apply (national organization with Bay Area focus).

### Policy Questions This Analysis Informs

- Should the organization's primary purpose be fellowship, professional development, or both? (Models 1 vs. 2)
- Should the bylaws explicitly name newcomer support as a purpose? (TAAGNY model)
- Should scholarship be a named purpose? If so, should a separate foundation be considered? (USTCAF/CTUAAA model)
- Does the geographic scope need to be clarified in the purpose statement?
