# Policy Questions: Vision and Purpose

These are the questions the organization must answer before drafting the vision and purpose article of the revised By-Laws. Each question reflects a real policy choice rather than a legal requirement.

## 1. What is the geographic scope of "America"?

The organization's name says "Alumni, America," but this term is never defined. Does the organization intend to serve:
- Only alumni residing in the continental United States?
- All 50 U.S. states including Hawaii and Alaska?
- U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico, Guam, or the U.S. Virgin Islands?
- Canada and/or Mexico, treated informally as part of "North America"?

This matters for membership eligibility, meeting logistics, and how the organization positions itself relative to other SCUT alumni chapters worldwide. A clear geographic boundary also helps distinguish this organization from any future regional chapters (e.g., a separate East Coast or West Coast SCUT alumni group).

## 2. Whom does the organization ultimately exist to serve?

The five purposes in the current By-Laws mix internal member benefits (friendship, professional development) with outward-facing goals (supporting SCUT's development and reputation). The organization should decide:
- Is the primary beneficiary the members themselves, or the broader SCUT community including the university itself?
- Should the organization explicitly include a commitment to supporting prospective or newly-arrived SCUT students in America (e.g., helping new graduates navigate life in the U.S.)?
- Should the organization serve the Chinese-American community more broadly, or remain strictly alumni-focused?

The answer shapes what kinds of events, partnerships, and spending are considered "on-mission" versus outside the organization's scope.

## 3. Should the organization adopt an explicit values statement, or keep only a list of purposes?

The current By-Laws list five operational purposes but state no unifying values. Many modern nonprofits include a brief values statement (e.g., a commitment to inclusivity, mutual respect, or cultural exchange) that guides how the organization pursues its purposes.

- Does the organization want to articulate values such as community, integrity, excellence, or cross-cultural connection?
- Should any values be derived from SCUT's own institutional values or motto?
- Or does the organization prefer to keep the By-Laws purely functional and leave values to separate policy documents?

## 4. Should the non-political clause be expanded or clarified?

The current By-Laws prohibit "political activities" but do not define what that means. In practice, activities that might seem borderline include:
- Inviting elected officials or government representatives to speak at events
- Advocating on immigration policies that directly affect alumni (e.g., visa issues, international student policies)
- Taking organizational positions on issues of direct relevance to Chinese-Americans

Should the By-Laws define "political activities" narrowly (e.g., endorsing candidates or parties) or broadly (any attempt to influence legislation or public policy)? Should there be an exception for civic engagement activities that do not constitute partisan politics?

---

## 5. Should the organization explicitly acknowledge its connection to SCUT as an institution?

The current By-Laws mention SCUT by name but treat the relationship informally. The organization should decide:
- Is the organization formally affiliated with, chartered by, or recognized by SCUT as an official alumni organization?
- If so, should the By-Laws acknowledge this relationship and any obligations that come with it (e.g., sharing membership data with SCUT, flying the SCUT flag, coordinating with the university's alumni office)?
- If not formally affiliated, should the By-Laws be explicit that the organization is independent of SCUT and does not speak on the university's behalf?

---

## 6. Should the mission statement be written in both English and Chinese?

Given that a significant portion of the membership is more comfortable in Chinese, the organization should decide whether the official By-Laws:
- Are English-only (the legal standard for a California corporation)
- Include an unofficial Chinese translation as an appendix
- Are formally bilingual, with both versions considered authoritative

If both versions are authoritative, what happens in the event of a conflict between translations?

---

## 7. Should there be an explicit statement about cultural identity and community?

The organization's informal identity is likely tied to both SCUT pride and Chinese cultural heritage in America. Should the By-Laws include a purpose clause acknowledging the cultural dimension of the organization's work — for example, fostering cultural exchange, preserving connections to Chinese heritage, or building community among Chinese-American professionals? Or should the By-Laws remain neutral on cultural identity and focus only on the alumni connection?
