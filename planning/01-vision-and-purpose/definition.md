# Topic: Organization's Vision and Purpose

## Definition

This topic covers the foundational statement of why the organization exists and what it aims to achieve. It answers:

- What is the organization's mission?
- Who does it serve?
- What values guide its work?
- What is the scope of its activities (geographic, professional, cultural)?
- What the organization explicitly does not do (e.g., no political activity, no profit distribution)

The vision and purpose section sets the intent that all other By-Law provisions serve. Any proposed activity or rule should be evaluated against this foundation.
