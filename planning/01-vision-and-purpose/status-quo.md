# Status Quo: Organization's Vision and Purpose

## What the Current By-Laws Say

**Article I — Name**
Establishes the official name: South China University of Technology Alumni, America.

**Article III — Purposes**
Lists five purposes:
- Promote communication among members
- Promote professional development and personal growth
- Provide opportunities to share common interests and friendship
- Enhance connection between members and SCUT
- Help support SCUT's development and worldwide reputation

States that the organization is not organized for profit, and no assets shall benefit any member. Members are not compensated except for board-approved expenses.

States that the organization shall not participate in political activities or activities that jeopardize its tax-exempt status.

## Gaps and Observations

- No vision statement or overarching value statement exists; only a list of operational purposes.
- The geographic scope ("America") is informal and undefined.
- There is no statement of who the organization ultimately serves (members only, or also the broader SCUT community and public?).
- The non-profit and non-political clauses are present but not connected to a broader values framework.
