# By-Laws Revision — Board Member Policy Questionnaire

**South China University of Technology Alumni, America**
**Issued by:** By-Laws Revision Drafting Committee
**Deadline for responses:** *(to be filled in)*
**Submit to:** *(Secretary's name and contact)*

---

## Purpose of This Questionnaire

The organization is revising its By-Laws, which were last adopted in December 2002. Before drafting can begin, the Board of Directors must make a set of **policy decisions** — choices about how the organization should be governed that are not dictated by law but reflect the organization's values and practical needs.

This questionnaire covers all major policy areas. Your answers will be synthesized and presented to the full Board for final decisions. The goal is to surface individual perspectives and areas of agreement or disagreement before the Board meeting, so that meeting time can be spent on real deliberation rather than discovering positions from scratch.

**You do not need legal expertise to answer these questions.** They ask about practical governance preferences, organizational values, and operational realities — things you know from experience as a Board member.

---

## How to Complete This Questionnaire

- Answer each question in your own words. There are no right or wrong answers.
- For each question, the **"Your response should address:"** box tells you what specific points to cover. You do not need to answer every sub-point if some do not apply.
- If you are unsure about a question, indicate that and explain what additional information you would need to form a view.
- **Estimated time to complete: 60–90 minutes.** You do not need to complete it in one sitting.
- If you strongly support or oppose a particular option, please say so and briefly explain why. The most useful responses include reasoning, not just a preference.

## 1. Vision and Purpose

*The current By-Laws list five purposes but contain no vision statement, no values, and no definition of whom the organization ultimately serves. This section asks the Board to clarify the organization's fundamental identity.*

---

### Q1.1 — Geographic Scope

The organization's name says "Alumni, America," but this is never defined in the By-Laws. As a result, it is unclear whether alumni in Hawaii, Alaska, Canada, or U.S. territories are eligible members.

**Your response should address:**
- Which geographic area should the By-Laws define as this organization's territory? (e.g., the 50 U.S. states only; U.S. states plus territories; North America broadly)
- If a SCUT alumnus lives in Canada, should they be eligible to join — or is that a different organization's responsibility?
- Should the By-Laws contemplate the possibility of future regional chapters, and if so, should the national body's territory be defined accordingly?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q1.2 — Whom Does the Organization Serve?

The current purposes mix member-focused goals (friendship, professional development) with outward-facing goals (supporting SCUT's development and worldwide reputation). The Board should decide whether the primary beneficiary is the membership itself, the broader SCUT community, or both.

**Your response should address:**
- Who is the primary beneficiary of this organization — its own members, or also the SCUT community at large (including SCUT itself, current students, and prospective students)?
- Should the organization explicitly commit to supporting newly-arrived SCUT graduates transitioning to life in the U.S. — or is that outside its scope?
- Should the organization serve the broader Chinese-American or SCUT-adjacent community, or remain strictly an alumni association?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q1.3 — Values and Cultural Identity

The current By-Laws are purely operational. Many peer organizations adopt a brief statement of values or explicitly acknowledge the cultural dimension of their work.

**Your response should address:**
- Should the By-Laws include a values statement (e.g., community, mutual support, cultural pride, excellence)? If yes, what values would you include?
- Should the By-Laws explicitly mention the cultural or Chinese heritage dimension of the organization's work, or keep the language neutral and functional?
- Should any values be drawn from SCUT's own institutional motto or ethos?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q1.4 — Non-Political Clause and Relationship with SCUT

The By-Laws currently prohibit "political activities" without defining what that means. They also mention SCUT without defining the relationship.

**Your response should address:**
- How should "political activities" be defined? For example: Does it only mean endorsing candidates/parties? Or also advocating on immigration or visa policies that directly affect alumni? What about inviting elected officials to speak?
- Is this organization formally affiliated with, recognized by, or endorsed by SCUT's alumni office? Should the By-Laws say so — and if so, what obligations does that relationship create?
- If the organization is independent of SCUT, should the By-Laws say so explicitly?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q1.5 — Language of the By-Laws

The current By-Laws are in English only. Many members are more comfortable in Chinese.

**Your response should address:**
- Should the By-Laws remain English-only (the legally required language for a California corporation)?
- Should a Chinese translation be provided as an unofficial appendix for members' reference?
- If both versions are produced, which version controls in case of conflict?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

## 2. Leadership Structure

*The current By-Laws create a Board of 11–21 Directors, a Chairman, up to six Vice Chairmen, a Secretary, and a Treasurer — all serving three-year terms. No other roles are defined. This section asks the Board to modernize the leadership structure.*

---

### Q2.1 — Board Size and Composition

The current range of 11–21 Directors is wide. The minimum of 11 can be difficult to sustain; the maximum of 21 may make meetings unwieldy.

**Your response should address:**
- Is the current range (11–21) still appropriate, or should it be adjusted? If so, what range would you recommend?
- Should the Board size be fixed (e.g., exactly 15) rather than a range, to make quorum calculations predictable?
- How many active, engaged Board members does the organization realistically have, and what minimum is achievable?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q2.2 — Officer Titles and Roles

The current titles (Chairman, Vice Chairmen) are gendered and old-fashioned by modern standards. The Vice Chairmen currently have no defined portfolios.

**Your response should address:**
- Should titles be updated? (Options: keep Chairman/Vice Chairmen; adopt President/Vice President; adopt Chair/Vice Chair)
- How many Vice Presidents/Vice Chairs should there be? Should each have a defined role (e.g., one for internal affairs, one for events, one for SCUT relations)?
- Should any new officer roles be formally created — for example, a Communications Officer or a Young Alumni Coordinator?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q2.3 — Executive Committee

Some peer organizations create a small Executive Committee (typically President + Vice Presidents) that can make routine decisions between full Board meetings, subject to Board ratification.

**Your response should address:**
- Should an Executive Committee be established with delegated authority to act on routine matters between Board meetings?
- If yes, what decisions can the Executive Committee make on its own, and which must go to the full Board?
- Is there a risk that an Executive Committee would sideline the broader Board — and how should the By-Laws guard against that?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q2.4 — Term Limits and Staggered Terms

Currently all Directors serve three-year terms with no limit on consecutive terms, and all terms start and end at the same time. This risks both indefinite incumbency and complete board turnover at once.

**Your response should address:**
- Should there be a maximum number of consecutive terms a Director or officer may serve (e.g., three terms, after which a one-term gap is required)?
- Should terms be staggered so that only a portion of the Board is up for election each year, preserving institutional continuity?
- If staggered terms are adopted, how would the transition be managed the first time?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q2.5 — Succession, Line of Authority, and Board-Member Relationship

The current By-Laws are silent on what happens if the Chairman and all Vice Chairmen are simultaneously unavailable, and say little about what decisions must go to the membership.

**Your response should address:**
- What is the line of succession if the Chairman and all Vice Chairmen are unavailable — who acts next (e.g., the Secretary)?
- Should there be any decisions, beyond By-Law amendments, that require a membership vote (e.g., dissolution, major expenditures)?
- Should members have a formal right to petition the Board to address a specific issue?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

## 3. Elections and Appointments

*The current By-Laws leave the nomination process undefined, the electronic voting process without rules, and mid-term vacancies without clear procedures.*

---

### Q3.1 — Nomination Process

Any member can currently be nominated "by a method authorized by the Board," but no method has been defined. This leaves elections vulnerable to confusion.

**Your response should address:**
- Is self-nomination allowed, or must candidates be nominated by other members?
- Should a nominating committee review and present candidates, or should anyone who wishes to run be free to do so?
- Should candidates be required to submit a biography, a brief platform statement, or a minimum service commitment?
- Should there be a minimum membership tenure before a person can run (e.g., at least one year as a member)?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q3.2 — Electronic Voting

The By-Laws say elections "can be held electronically" but specify no platform, no verification method, and no process for counting or certifying results.

**Your response should address:**
- Which platforms should be approved for electronic voting (e.g., a dedicated voting tool, Google Form, email ballot)? What authentication method confirms that only eligible members vote once each?
- How long should the voting window be open?
- Who administers and certifies the results, and are vote totals made public?
- Should electronic voting be the default, or should in-person voting at the annual meeting be the default?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q3.3 — Removal of Officers and Mid-Term Vacancies

The current By-Laws allow the Chairman and Vice Chairmen to be recalled via a petition by one-third of the Board, but there is no process for removing the Secretary or Treasurer, and vacancies in officer positions are unaddressed.

**Your response should address:**
- Should all officers be subject to the same recall process? Should "for cause" be required, or should a no-confidence vote suffice?
- If the Chairman vacates mid-term, does the senior Vice Chairman automatically become Chairman, or should there be a new election?
- Should mid-term replacements serve only the remainder of the original term?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q3.4 — Transition and Handover Requirements

There is currently no rule requiring outgoing officers to transfer organizational assets, accounts, and records to their successors.

**Your response should address:**
- Should there be a mandatory handover period (e.g., one month of overlap) between outgoing and incoming officers?
- What should be included in a handover: bank account access, digital accounts, records, contact lists?
- What is the deadline for completing the handover, and what happens if an outgoing officer does not comply?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

## 4. Membership and Eligibility

*The current By-Laws define eligibility vaguely and have no registration process, no dues structure, and no process for lapsed or terminated membership.*

---

### Q4.1 — Eligibility Criteria

"Worked or studied at SCUT and currently lives or works in America" leaves many cases ambiguous.

**Your response should address:**
- Should "studied at SCUT" require a degree, or does an exchange semester or short program count?
- Does a current SCUT graduate student at a U.S. university qualify?
- What happens to a member who moves back to China — do they retain membership?
- Should faculty, staff, and administrators of SCUT be eligible (not just academic alumni)?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q4.2 — Membership Categories

Many peer organizations distinguish between different types of members with different rights.

**Your response should address:**
- Should the organization create distinct membership categories? (e.g., Regular Members with full voting rights; Associate Members for family or supporters without voting rights; Student Members for current SCUT students in the U.S.; Honorary Members for major contributors)
- What rights and limitations should each category have (voting, holding office, attending events)?
- Should family members of alumni be eligible for any form of membership?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q4.3 — Dues Structure and Administration

The current By-Laws give the Board full discretion over dues with no further structure. There is no formal registration or roll-keeping process.

**Your response should address:**
- Should dues be defined in the By-Laws with a specific amount, or should the Board retain full discretion?
- Should there be different dues tiers — standard, student/recent graduate, lifetime?
- Who is responsible for maintaining the membership roll, and what information must it contain?
- How long after dues lapse does a member lose good standing and voting rights?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q4.4 — Disciplinary Process

There is currently no process for suspending or revoking a member's membership for misconduct.

**Your response should address:**
- Should the By-Laws include a process for suspending or expelling a member for serious misconduct?
- If yes, what process is required — who initiates it, who decides, and does the member have a right to be heard?
- What should the threshold be: a majority Board vote? A supermajority?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q4.5 — Meeting Notice Periods

The current one-week notice for membership meetings is too short for a geographically dispersed membership.

**Your response should address:**
- What notice period should apply to the annual membership meeting? (Most peer organizations use 21–30 days.)
- Should the notice include a draft agenda, candidate biographies, and financial summaries so members can prepare?
- Through what channels should notices be sent (email, WeChat, website)?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

## 5. Decision-Making Procedures

*The current By-Laws leave out quorum rules for membership meetings, proxy voting, written consent, and a number of other procedural basics.*

---

### Q5.1 — Quorum for Membership Meetings

There is no quorum defined for membership meetings, meaning any number could technically pass a binding resolution.

**Your response should address:**
- Should quorum be a fixed number (e.g., 20 members) or a percentage of the membership roll?
- What should the quorum threshold be?
- What happens if quorum is not reached — automatic adjournment to a later date, or a non-binding advisory session?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q5.2 — Proxy Voting and Electronic Pre-Voting

Members who cannot attend the annual meeting currently have no way to vote.

**Your response should address:**
- Should proxy voting be permitted — can a member authorize another member to vote on their behalf at the meeting?
- Alternatively (or additionally), should asynchronous electronic pre-voting before the meeting be permitted for certain votes (e.g., director elections)?
- If electronic pre-voting is used, how are votes authenticated and counted alongside in-person votes?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q5.3 — Action by Written Consent

California law allows a Board to take action without holding a meeting if all (or a defined majority of) directors consent in writing. This is useful for urgent, routine, or administrative decisions.

**Your response should address:**
- Should the By-Laws authorize Board action by written consent (including email or electronic signature) without a formal meeting?
- Should written consent require unanimity, or a supermajority?
- Should any category of decisions be excluded from written consent (e.g., officer elections, major expenditures)?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q5.4 — Supermajority Requirements

Only By-Law amendments currently require a supermajority (two-thirds member vote). Should other decisions also require elevated thresholds?

**Your response should address:**
- Which additional categories of decision, if any, should require more than a simple majority? Consider: dissolution; removal of an officer; expenditures above a certain dollar threshold; entering a major partnership or contract; changing the organization's name.
- For those decisions, what threshold is appropriate: two-thirds of those present, two-thirds of the full Board, three-fourths, or unanimous?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q5.5 — Voting Mechanics and Conflict of Interest at the Chair

The By-Laws say nothing about how votes are taken at meetings, or what happens when the Chairman has a personal interest in a vote.

**Your response should address:**
- Should routine decisions use voice vote or show of hands, with secret ballot reserved for contested elections and sensitive matters (e.g., officer removal)?
- When the Chairman has a personal interest in a matter being voted on, who should preside over that vote — the senior Vice Chairman, or a temporarily elected chair?
- For virtual meetings, what voting mechanism is acceptable (e.g., chat message, in-platform poll, a separate form)?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

## 6. California Law Compliance

*The current By-Laws were written with little regard for the specific requirements of California's Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation Law. This section addresses gaps that create legal risk.*

---

### Q6.1 — Director and Officer Indemnification

California law permits nonprofits to protect directors and officers from personal liability for actions taken in good faith in their organizational roles. Without this protection, it may be difficult to recruit capable volunteers.

**Your response should address:**
- Should the By-Laws include an indemnification provision protecting directors and officers from personal liability for good-faith actions in their roles?
- Should indemnification be mandatory (they must be indemnified if conditions are met) or permissive (the Board decides case by case)?
- Should the organization purchase Directors and Officers (D&O) liability insurance?
- What conduct should be excluded from protection (e.g., fraud, willful misconduct)?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q6.2 — Member Inspection Rights and State Filing Obligations

California law gives members the right to inspect certain corporate records. It also requires corporations to file a biennial Statement of Information — failure to do so can result in suspension.

**Your response should address:**
- Should the By-Laws describe members' right to inspect records, and the process for requesting access (who to contact, how much notice, what documents are available)?
- Who should be explicitly responsible in the By-Laws for filing the biennial Statement of Information with the California Secretary of State?
- Should there be a Board-level check each year to confirm that state filings have been made?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q6.3 — Limiting Director Liability and Governing Law Reference

California law permits nonprofits to limit directors' personal liability for monetary damages in certain circumstances.

**Your response should address:**
- Should the By-Laws include a clause limiting directors' personal liability for monetary damages for breach of the duty of care (to the extent permitted by California law)?
- Should the By-Laws include a general provision stating that matters not addressed by the By-Laws are governed by California Nonprofit Corporation Law (Title 3, Part 3)?
- Should the By-Laws reference California law explicitly in their text, or be written in plain language that is simply designed to comply with it?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

## 7. Financial Management

*The current By-Laws address finances in a single paragraph: deposit funds in a federally insured bank; require two signatures for withdrawals. The entire modern financial operation of the organization is unaddressed.*

---

### Q7.1 — Expenditure Approval Thresholds

There are no defined dollar thresholds for what the Treasurer can spend autonomously versus what requires Board approval.

**Your response should address:**
- Below what dollar amount may the Treasurer pay expenses without seeking additional approval (e.g., routine expenses under $200)?
- Above what dollar amount does an expenditure require full Board approval before being made?
- Should there be a middle tier — e.g., amounts between $200 and $2,000 approved jointly by the President and Treasurer without a full Board meeting?
- How should emergency expenditures (e.g., a last-minute deposit) be handled?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q7.2 — Annual Budget and Financial Reporting

There is currently no budget process or defined format for the Treasurer's annual report.

**Your response should address:**
- Should an annual budget be prepared and approved by the Board at the beginning of each fiscal year? Who prepares it?
- Should the budget be presented to the membership at the annual meeting (for information or approval)?
- What should the Treasurer's annual financial report include? (e.g., balance sheet, income statement, comparison to budget)
- What is the organization's fiscal year — January 1 to December 31, or another period?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q7.3 — Modern Payment Methods and Digital Finance

The current two-signature rule was written for paper checks, but most transactions now happen through PayPal, Zelle, Venmo, or similar platforms — which do not support two-person authorization.

**Your response should address:**
- Which digital payment platforms should be authorized for collecting dues and event fees?
- How should the two-authorization requirement be adapted for digital transactions — for example, requiring both the President and Treasurer to approve a PayPal transfer before it is sent?
- Should any account that holds organizational funds have two administrators at all times?
- Can the organization hold a debit card, and if so, who controls it and what are the per-transaction limits?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q7.4 — Financial Review, Record Retention, and Treasurer Succession

There are no requirements for independent financial review, record retention, or how to handle a mid-term Treasurer vacancy.

**Your response should address:**
- Should there be an independent financial review — an internal Finance Committee review, a CPA compilation, or a full external audit? At what revenue or asset level should this be required?
- How long must financial records be retained, and in what format (digital, paper, cloud)?
- If the Treasurer vacates mid-term, who immediately assumes signatory authority, and what is the timeline for a formal handover?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

## 8. Meetings and Notices

*The current By-Laws require only one Board meeting per year, provide only one week's notice, and make no mention of virtual meetings.*

---

### Q8.1 — Board Meeting Frequency and Format

One Board meeting per year is insufficient for active organizational oversight.

**Your response should address:**
- How many regular Board meetings should be required per year? (Most active peer organizations hold at least four — quarterly.)
- Should the By-Laws distinguish between formal Board meetings (with quorum requirements and minutes) and shorter informal check-ins?
- Should virtual Board meetings (e.g., via Zoom) be explicitly authorized, and should virtual participation count equally toward quorum?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q8.2 — Notice Periods and Content

One week's advance notice is very short for a geographically dispersed membership or board.

**Your response should address:**
- What notice period should apply to: the annual membership meeting; regular Board meetings; special/emergency Board meetings?
- What information must a meeting notice include? (e.g., date, time, location/link, agenda, candidate list, financial report, proposed amendments)
- Should notice via WeChat be formally recognized as a valid and official notification channel?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q8.3 — Meeting Records and Quorum Failure

The By-Laws have no rules for minutes at membership meetings, and no procedure for what happens when a meeting cannot reach quorum.

**Your response should address:**
- Should full minutes be taken at every Board meeting and annual membership meeting, approved at the following meeting, and made accessible to all members?
- If the annual membership meeting fails to reach quorum, should it be automatically adjourned to a later date at which any attending members constitute quorum?
- Should there be a fixed target time of year for the annual membership meeting (e.g., within the first quarter of each year)?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

## 9. Digital Operations and Communications

*The current By-Laws were drafted in 2002. The organization's actual operations — WeChat, website, social media, digital payments, electronic documents — exist entirely outside the governing document.*

---

### Q9.1 — Official Communication Channels

The organization communicates through email, WeChat, possibly a website, and other platforms, but none of these are recognized in the governing documents.

**Your response should address:**
- Which channels should be designated as "official" for membership notices, Board communications, and organizational announcements? (e.g., email; a specific WeChat group; the official website)
- Should WeChat group messages from officers be treated as official organizational communications, or as personal communications unless specifically labeled otherwise?
- Should the organization maintain a single canonical membership email list that members are required to subscribe to?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q9.2 — Digital Asset Ownership and Account Handover

When an officer leaves, they may retain access to accounts they set up personally — domain names, email addresses, social media accounts, WeChat groups.

**Your response should address:**
- Should all organizational digital accounts (domain, website, email, social media) be owned by the organization rather than by any individual officer?
- Should the By-Laws require at least two officers to have admin access to each official digital account at all times?
- What should the deadline be for a departing officer to transfer all account credentials to their successor, and what happens if they refuse?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q9.3 — Member Data Privacy

The membership roll contains personal data (names, contact information, alumni details). There are no rules for how this data is used, stored, or protected.

**Your response should address:**
- Should the organization adopt a privacy policy covering how member data is collected, stored, and used?
- Should member data be stored in an officially designated system (not in an individual officer's personal files)?
- Should there be restrictions on who within the organization can access the full membership roll?
- Should the organization acknowledge any obligations under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q9.4 — Digital Records and Electronic Voting Integrity

There are no rules for how digital records are organized, retained, or backed up, and electronic voting is referenced in the By-Laws but completely unspecified.

**Your response should address:**
- Should the organization maintain a central shared digital archive (e.g., a shared Google Drive) accessible to all Board members, organized by year and document type?
- Which platforms or tools are approved for conducting member votes electronically? How is voter identity verified and vote integrity maintained?
- Should electronic votes be archived as part of the organization's official records?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

## 10. Committees

*The current By-Laws contain no committee structure at all. Any committees that currently exist have no formal standing, authority, or accountability.*

---

### Q10.1 — Which Standing Committees Should Be Established?

The Board must decide which committees are important enough to be defined in the By-Laws, versus which should be created informally as needed.

**Your response should address:**
- Should any of the following be established as named standing committees in the By-Laws?
  - **Finance Committee** — reviews financial reports and advises the Board
  - **Election/Nominating Committee** — independently administers nominations and elections
  - **Events Committee** — plans annual banquet and other major events
  - **Membership Committee** — manages the membership roll and dues collection
  - **Communications Committee** — manages website, email, WeChat, and public presence
  - **SCUT Relations Committee** — coordinates with SCUT's alumni office
  - **Young Alumni Committee** — engages new graduates and current SCUT students in the U.S.
- Are there other committees important to the organization's actual operations that are not on this list?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q10.2 — Committee Authority, Composition, and Accountability

For each committee that will be established, the By-Laws must define who sits on it, what it can decide, and how it reports back.

**Your response should address:**
- Should committee members be required to be current members in good standing, or can non-member volunteers serve in an operational capacity?
- Who appoints committee chairs — the President, the Board, or the committee members?
- Can a committee take binding action on its own (e.g., approve an event venue), or can it only make recommendations to the Board?
- Should spending authority be delegated to specific committees within a Board-approved budget?
- Should each standing committee be required to provide a written report at each regular Board meeting and an annual report at the annual membership meeting?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

## 11. Conflict of Interest

*The current By-Laws contain no conflict of interest provisions. California law (Corporations Code §7233) regulates self-dealing by directors of nonprofit mutual benefit corporations, but the By-Laws must set out how the organization will implement that requirement.*

---

### Q11.1 — Scope and Disclosure

A conflict of interest policy is only useful if the organization can clearly identify when a conflict exists and ensure it is disclosed.

**Your response should address:**
- What should count as a conflict of interest? Should the policy cover: financial conflicts only; or also personal relationships (e.g., contracting with a family member's business); or situations where the director's employer has an interest in a Board decision?
- Who is subject to the policy — only Board directors, or also officers, committee chairs, and major volunteers?
- Should all directors be required to submit a written annual disclosure listing any relationships or interests that could constitute a conflict — not just disclose at the meeting where an issue arises?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

### Q11.2 — Recusal, Voting, and Consequences

Once a conflict is disclosed, the Board must decide how the affected director is treated.

**Your response should address:**
- Should an interested director be permitted to participate in discussion before recusing, or must they leave immediately?
- Should the interested director's presence be excluded from the quorum count for the vote on the conflicted matter?
- What are the consequences of failing to disclose a known conflict — a warning for a first offense, removal proceedings for a serious or repeated violation?
- Should a transaction approved without proper disclosure of a conflict be voidable (reversible)?

> **Your answer:**
>
>
>
>

---

## 12. Dissolution

*The current By-Laws say nothing about how the organization would be dissolved. This is both a legal gap and a practical one: if the organization ever becomes inactive, there must be a defined process for winding down.*

---

### Q12.1 — Conditions, Authority, and Vote Threshold

**Your response should address:**
- Should dissolution only be possible in extreme circumstances (e.g., sustained inactivity, leadership vacuum), or should it be an ordinary governance decision available at any time?
- Who can initiate a dissolution vote — the Board alone; the membership by petition; any officer?
- What vote is required to approve dissolution? (Recommended minimum: two-thirds of the full Board, followed by two-thirds of members at a specially noticed membership meeting.)
- Should the notice period for a dissolution vote be longer than for ordinary amendments — for example, 60 days instead of 30?

### Q12.2 — Asset Distribution

California law and IRS 501(c)(7) rules prohibit distributing organizational assets to members for personal benefit upon dissolution. The organization must specify where remaining assets go.

**Your response should address:**
- Should remaining assets after paying all debts go to: another SCUT alumni organization; SCUT directly; a specified Chinese-American nonprofit or community foundation; or a recipient chosen by the Board at the time of dissolution?
- If the organization names a specific recipient, what is the fallback if that recipient no longer exists?
- Should there be a merger or reorganization pathway as an alternative to full dissolution — for example, the option to merge into a future national SCUT alumni association?

## 13. Federal IRS 501(c)(7) Compliance

*The current By-Laws do not mention the organization's federal tax-exempt status. This section addresses governance provisions needed to protect and maintain that status.*

---

### Q13.1 — Declaring and Maintaining 501(c)(7) Status

**Your response should address:**
- Should the By-Laws include an explicit statement that the organization is organized and operated as a tax-exempt social club under IRC §501(c)(7)?
- Does the organization currently hold an IRS determination letter confirming 501(c)(7) status? If not, should obtaining one be a near-term priority?
- Should the By-Laws include a commitment to operate in compliance with 501(c)(7) requirements, so that Board members have a clear fiduciary duty to protect tax-exempt status?

### Q13.2 — Annual IRS Filing and Revenue Monitoring

501(c)(7) organizations must file an annual Form 990 with the IRS. They must also ensure that at least 65% of gross receipts come from members.

**Your response should address:**
- Should the By-Laws explicitly assign IRS annual filing responsibility to the Treasurer, with oversight by the Board (i.e., the Board reviews and approves the Form 990 before it is filed)?
- Should a CPA or tax professional be engaged to prepare the Form 990, and should the Board authorize this expense in the annual budget?
- Should the Treasurer be required to track member revenue vs. non-member revenue throughout the year and report the composition to the Board? At what point should an alert be triggered if non-member revenue approaches the 35% IRS ceiling?

### Q13.3 — Non-Member Activity, Private Inurement, and Non-Discrimination

501(c)(7) rules limit non-member income and prohibit private benefit to individuals. IRS policy also prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or religion.

**Your response should address:**
- Should the By-Laws include an explicit private inurement prohibition — stating that no part of net earnings shall inure to the benefit of any individual member, director, or officer?
- Should the organization establish a Board-approval requirement before accepting any corporate sponsorship or large non-member donation, to manage 501(c)(7) compliance?
- Should the By-Laws include a non-discrimination statement? Should it cover only what IRS requires (race, color, religion) or be broader (e.g., national origin, gender, sexual orientation)?

### Q13.4 — Record Retention and Response to Loss of Tax-Exempt Status

Under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, three consecutive years of failing to file a Form 990 result in automatic loss of tax-exempt status.

**Your response should address:**
- Should the By-Laws specify a minimum retention period for financial and tax records — for example, seven years from the date of the relevant filing?
- Should the IRS determination letter (if one exists) and all Form 990 filings be retained permanently?
- Should the By-Laws establish a procedure for what happens if the organization's 501(c)(7) status is revoked — who is responsible for initiating reinstatement, and should there be an automatic special Board meeting within 30 days of discovering the revocation?
