# Analysis Report: FDAAGLA vs. SCUT Alumni America

**Organization:** Fudan University Alumni Association of Greater Los Angeles (FDAAGLA)
**SCUT Baseline:** South China University of Technology Alumni, America (By-Laws adopted December 10, 2002)

---

## Overview

FDAAGLA and SCUT Alumni America are highly comparable peer organizations: both are California nonprofit organizations serving alumni of prominent Chinese universities in the greater Los Angeles/California area, both are non-political and non-profit, and both use a Board of Directors governance structure. FDAAGLA's bylaws, which are publicly available, reflect a somewhat more contemporary and member-rights-oriented governance philosophy than SCUT Alumni America's 2002 document, making FDAAGLA a particularly instructive reference point.

## Similarities

### 1. California Nonprofit Structure
Both are California-based nonprofit organizations, making them subject to the same state regulatory framework.

### 2. Mission Parallelism
FDAAGLA's purposes—promoting friendship and networking, providing mutual support, facilitating information exchange with the home university, encouraging educational exchange and cultural understanding—map closely onto SCUT Alumni America's purposes of promoting communication, professional development, shared interests, connection to SCUT, and support for SCUT's development.

### 3. Non-Profit, Non-Political
Both explicitly prohibit asset distribution to members and prohibit political activity.

### 4. Board of Directors Governance
Both vest governing authority in a Board of Directors, which appoints or elects officers including a Chairman/President, Vice Chairmen/Vice Presidents, Secretary, and Treasurer.

### 5. University-Affiliation Eligibility
Both define membership based on having graduated from or studied at the respective Chinese university.

### 6. Two Signatures for Withdrawals
Both require two authorized officer signatures for financial withdrawals.

### 7. Membership Meeting Agenda Items
Both specify that the annual membership meeting includes director elections, financial reporting, and review of the organization's past year's work.

## Differences

### 1. Membership Categories: Tiered vs. Single Class
FDAAGLA has three distinct membership categories: General Members (full rights), Associate Members (no voting), and Honorary Members (no dues, no voting). SCUT Alumni America has a single membership class (all alumni are eligible members) without explicit distinction between voting and non-voting members, or between paying and honorary members. FDAAGLA's tiered structure:
- More explicitly protects voting members' rights by separating them from non-voting participants
- Creates a pathway to engage friends and family of alumni as Associate Members
- Allows recognition of major contributors through Honorary Membership

### 2. Minimum Study Duration Requirement
FDAAGLA requires that members have studied at Fudan University for at least two (2) years prior to membership eligibility. SCUT Alumni America requires only that the person "worked or studied" at SCUT, with no minimum duration. FDAAGLA's two-year requirement helps ensure that members have a meaningful connection to the university and community.

### 3. Geographic Residency Requirement
FDAAGLA requires members to have resided in the Greater Los Angeles Area for at least one (1) year before joining. SCUT Alumni America has no geographic residency duration requirement. This residency requirement helps FDAAGLA maintain a genuinely engaged local membership rather than one with only superficial ties to the area.

### 4. Prohibition on Proxy Voting
FDAAGLA explicitly prohibits proxy voting: members must vote in person. SCUT Alumni America's bylaws do not address proxy voting. The prohibition on proxies prevents manipulation of meeting outcomes by having one person control multiple votes.

### 5. Director Term Length: 2-Year vs. 3-Year
FDAAGLA uses two-year Director terms with a limit of three consecutive terms. SCUT Alumni America uses three-year terms with no limit. The FDAAGLA model:
- Allows more frequent member input into Board composition
- Prevents indefinite service in a single Board seat
- Requires planning for succession

### 6. Amendment Process: Two-Stage (Board then Members) vs. Members-Only
FDAAGLA's amendment process requires: (i) simple majority Board approval, then (ii) simple majority member ratification at the annual meeting. SCUT Alumni America requires: (i) proposal by 10% of members or 6 Directors, (ii) 30-day notice, (iii) two-thirds member vote.

The two processes reflect different governance philosophies:
- FDAAGLA's lower threshold (simple majority of both) makes amendment more accessible
- SCUT's higher threshold (two-thirds member vote) better protects the bylaws from hasty changes
- FDAAGLA's two-stage process ensures both Board and member input
- SCUT's process gives members the final word even on initiatives the Board opposes

### 7. Director Compensation Clause
FDAAGLA explicitly states that "Directors shall serve without compensation except that they may be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses... as approved by a majority of the Board." SCUT Alumni America states that "no member shall be compensated for his or her services except for expenses approved by the Board" in its purposes clause but does not specifically address Director compensation in the governance article. An explicit Director compensation policy in the Board article is cleaner and more transparent.

### 8. Video Conference Meetings
FDAAGLA explicitly permits Board meetings "by conference call, video conference, or other electronic means." SCUT Alumni America's bylaws are silent on this point. This provision became standard practice during and after the COVID-19 pandemic and is essential for any modern organization.

### 9. Fiscal Year
FDAAGLA specifies its fiscal year ends December 31. SCUT Alumni America's bylaws do not specify a fiscal year.

### 10. No Committee Structure in SCUT
FDAAGLA provides for standing and special committees, while SCUT Alumni America has no committee provisions.

### 11. Dissolution Clause
FDAAGLA specifies that upon dissolution, assets go to similar nonprofit organizations with no assets inuring to members. SCUT Alumni America has no dissolution clause.

## What SCUT Alumni America Can Learn from FDAAGLA

### Highest Priority

1. **Introduce membership categories.** Creating distinct General Member (voting), Associate Member (non-voting), and Honorary Member categories is good governance practice. It clarifies who has voting rights, creates a pathway for friends and family to participate, and provides a vehicle for recognizing significant contributors.

2. **Explicitly prohibit proxy voting—or explicitly allow it with conditions.** The bylaws should clearly address this question. If members can participate electronically, the need for proxies is reduced; if meetings are in-person only, prohibiting proxies prevents manipulation.

3. **Consider adding minimum engagement criteria.** A minimum study duration (e.g., one year at SCUT) or residency duration could help maintain a genuinely engaged membership.

4. **Add video conference provisions.** Explicitly authorizing Board and membership meetings by video conference reflects post-2020 reality and is essential for a geographically dispersed organization.

5. **Specify the fiscal year.** This is a simple but important clarification.

### Secondary Priorities

6. **Add a Director compensation clause.** Making the no-compensation policy explicit at the Board article level (rather than only in the purposes clause) is cleaner governance.

7. **Consider shorter Director terms with term limits.** Two-year terms with three-term limits may encourage broader participation in governance than SCUT's current three-year unlimited terms.

8. **Consider the two-stage amendment process.** Requiring both Board approval and member ratification (at potentially lower thresholds than SCUT's current 2/3 requirement) could make the amendment process more practical while still protecting member rights.

## Summary Assessment

FDAAGLA is SCUT Alumni America's most direct peer in the Southern California Chinese alumni association landscape. Its bylaws address several gaps in SCUT's 2002 document—particularly membership categories, proxy rules, video conferencing, fiscal year, Director term limits, and dissolution—that SCUT's revision should incorporate. FDAAGLA's amendment process (Board approval + member ratification, each by simple majority) is worth considering as an alternative to SCUT's current high-threshold members-only process, though there are legitimate arguments for maintaining SCUT's higher two-thirds requirement given its role in protecting foundational governance.
