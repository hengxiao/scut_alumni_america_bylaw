# Fudan University Alumni Association of Greater Los Angeles (FDAAGLA)

## Overview

The **Fudan University Alumni Association of Greater Los Angeles (FDAAGLA)** is an independent, non-profit, and non-political organization serving alumni of Fudan University (复旦大学) who reside or work in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The association is incorporated as a California nonprofit and its governing bylaws are publicly available on its website. It covers alumni across five counties: Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura.

## History and Background

Fudan University is one of China's most prestigious comprehensive research universities, founded in 1905 in Shanghai. It is renowned for its programs in liberal arts, medicine, natural sciences, economics, and international studies. Fudan has produced generations of leaders in academia, government, business, and culture in both China and worldwide.

FDAAGLA was established to serve the growing community of Fudan alumni in the Los Angeles basin. Southern California has long been a destination for Chinese graduate students, researchers, and professionals, many of whom attended Fudan before pursuing careers abroad. The association formalizes connections among these alumni and serves as a liaison between the Los Angeles community and Fudan University.

## Mission and Purposes

FDAAGLA's stated purposes are to:

- Promote friendship, networking, and mutual benefit among association members
- Provide assistance and support to members in need
- Facilitate information exchange between members and Fudan University
- Encourage educational exchange and cultural understanding
- Organize and support scholarly and scientific forums
- Serve the needs of the Greater Los Angeles Fudan alumni community

## Organizational Character

FDAAGLA is independent of both Fudan University and any government entity. It is non-profit, non-political, and structured to serve its members' collective interests. The organization is run by a volunteer Board of Directors.

## Membership

FDAAGLA's membership structure distinguishes between:

- **General Members:** Individuals who have studied at Fudan University, the Shanghai Medical University (SMU, later merged with Fudan), or any predecessor institution for at least two years, and who have resided in the Greater Los Angeles area for at least one year prior to joining. General members pay annual dues of $20 or a lifetime fee of $200. Students with valid student IDs receive free membership. General members hold full voting rights.
- **Associate Members:** Spouses or close relatives of general members, or others with a significant connection to the Fudan community, who pay the same dues schedule but do not hold voting rights.

Each general member is entitled to one vote, and voting must be cast in person; proxy voting is not permitted.
