# Tsinghua Alumni Association of Greater New York (TAAGNY)

## Overview

The **Tsinghua Alumni Association of Greater New York (TAAGNY)** is a nonprofit organization and one of the oldest and most established Tsinghua University alumni chapters in North America. It was established in **1979** and formally became a **501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization in 1982**, giving it over four decades of history as a formalized nonprofit. The association serves alumni of Tsinghua University (清华大学, also written Qinghua) who reside, study, or work in the greater New York metropolitan area.

## History and Background

Tsinghua University, founded in Beijing in 1911, is one of China's two most prestigious universities (alongside Peking University) and is widely considered China's leading engineering and technology university. Its alumni have occupied top positions in government (including numerous Chinese Communist Party leaders), academia, and industry in both China and worldwide. Tsinghua's graduates in the United States are found in top research universities, technology companies, financial institutions, and multinational corporations.

TAAGNY was established in 1979, a period when Chinese students and scholars were beginning to return to or establish themselves in the United States following the normalization of U.S.-China relations. The early members of TAAGNY were often scientists and academics who had studied at Tsinghua before emigrating. The organization became one of the first Chinese university alumni associations in the northeastern United States to achieve formal 501(c)(3) status.

With approximately **8,000 alumni** in its network, TAAGNY is among the larger regional Chinese university alumni associations in the United States. Its members span fields including academia, education, biology, pharmacy, mechanical engineering, electronics, information technology, finance, accounting, architecture, real estate, and law.

## Mission and Purposes

TAAGNY's mission is to:

- Connect Tsinghua University alumni in the greater New York metropolitan area
- Foster friendship, mutual support, and professional networking among members
- Promote the educational and cultural legacy of Tsinghua University in the New York area
- Support Tsinghua University's academic mission through advocacy and fundraising
- Facilitate cultural exchange and understanding between the United States and China
- Coordinate with other Tsinghua alumni associations in North America through the North America Federation of Tsinghua Alumni Associations (NAFTHAA)

## Organizational Character

TAAGNY is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization, meaning its purposes are primarily educational and charitable, and donations to it are tax-deductible. This contrasts with social club (501(c)(7)) organizations, where membership benefits are the primary purpose. TAAGNY's 501(c)(3) status reflects its emphasis on educational exchange and cultural promotion.

## Relationship with the Broader Tsinghua Alumni Network

TAAGNY coordinates with the **North America Federation of Tsinghua Alumni Associations (NAFTHAA)**, an umbrella organization for Tsinghua alumni associations across North America that itself holds 501(c)(3) status. Globally, Tsinghua has over 146 active alumni associations worldwide, including 55 overseas chapters, reflecting the university's strong commitment to alumni engagement.

## Membership and Activities

TAAGNY's large membership base supports a broad range of activities including:
- Annual spring and fall banquets
- Academic lecture series by prominent Tsinghua alumni
- Industry-specific networking events (technology, finance, healthcare)
- Young alumni programs targeting recent graduates
- Mentorship connecting established alumni with new arrivals in New York
- Coordination with visiting Tsinghua delegations
