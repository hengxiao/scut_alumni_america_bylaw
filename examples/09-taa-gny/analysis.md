# Analysis Report: TAAGNY vs. SCUT Alumni America

**Organization:** Tsinghua Alumni Association of Greater New York (TAAGNY)
**SCUT Baseline:** South China University of Technology Alumni, America (By-Laws adopted December 10, 2002)

---

## Overview

TAAGNY is one of the most mature Chinese university alumni associations in the United States, having been established in 1979 and incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit since 1982. With approximately 8,000 alumni in its network, it is considerably larger than most peer organizations. TAAGNY's experience across more than four decades, its formal participation in a national federation (NAFTHAA), and its extensive committee structure make it an instructive model for SCUT Alumni America's governance revision—particularly as a case study in how an alumni association can scale and formalize while remaining member-driven.

## Similarities

### 1. Core Mission
Both organizations exist to serve alumni of prestigious Chinese universities in the United States, fostering fellowship, professional networking, cultural connection, and support for their respective alma maters. Both are non-profit, non-political, and alumni-community-serving.

### 2. Board of Directors Governance with Officers
Both use a Board of Directors as the primary governing body, with officers (President/Chairman, Vice Presidents, Secretary, Treasurer) elected from among the Directors.

### 3. University-Affiliation Membership Eligibility
Both define membership based on having graduated from or worked at the respective Chinese university.

### 4. Two-Signature Financial Controls
Both require at least two authorized signatures for financial transactions above a threshold.

### 5. Annual Membership Meeting
Both hold annual membership meetings that include Director elections, financial reporting, and organizational review.

### 6. Non-Partisan, Non-Profit Character
Both prohibit partisan political activity and asset distribution to members.

## Differences

### 1. IRS Status: 501(c)(3) vs. 501(c)(7)
TAAGNY's 501(c)(3) status enables tax-deductible contributions and positions the organization as having a primarily charitable/educational mission. SCUT Alumni America operates as a 501(c)(7) social club. TAAGNY's 43 years of 501(c)(3) operation demonstrate that an alumni association can thrive under the public benefit model.

### 2. Scale: ~8,000 Members vs. Smaller Membership
TAAGNY's network of 8,000 alumni reflects both Tsinghua's size and the large concentration of Tsinghua graduates in the New York area over many decades. The governance provisions of a large organization like TAAGNY are instructive for what SCUT Alumni America might need as it grows:
- A larger Board range (7–25 Directors vs. SCUT's 11–21) allows scale
- Specialized Vice President roles (First VP, Second VP, additional VPs for specific functions) manage organizational complexity
- An extensive committee structure distributes workload across the large membership

### 3. Functional Vice Presidents
TAAGNY uses multiple Vice Presidents with differentiated roles: First Vice President (acts as President in absence), Second Vice President (oversees chapter relations), and additional Vice Presidents for specific functional areas (e.g., Events, Membership, Young Alumni, Professional Development). SCUT Alumni America allows "up to six Vice Chairmen" but does not differentiate their responsibilities. TAAGNY's model of giving each Vice President a distinct portfolio:
- Clarifies responsibilities and prevents duplication
- Ensures key organizational functions have dedicated leadership
- Provides career development opportunities for Vice Presidents who can specialize

### 4. Director Terms: 2 vs. 3 Years, With Term Limits
TAAGNY uses two-year Director terms with a three-term maximum (six consecutive years maximum). SCUT Alumni America uses three-year terms with no limits. The TAAGNY model balances continuity with governance renewal.

### 5. Director Count: 7–25 vs. 11–21
TAAGNY's larger range (up to 25) accommodates its large membership and multiple committee needs. The lower minimum (7) provides flexibility if the organization needs to operate with a smaller active Board. SCUT's minimum of 11 may be appropriate for its current size but could be lowered to provide more operational flexibility.

### 6. 4 Board Meetings per Year vs. 1 Minimum
TAAGNY holds at least four Board meetings per year. SCUT Alumni America requires only one. Four meetings allows more timely decision-making, better organizational oversight, and stronger member engagement through Board service.

### 7. President Term Limit: Two Consecutive Terms
TAAGNY's bylaws limit the President to no more than two consecutive terms in that office. SCUT Alumni America's Chairman may serve indefinitely. A two-term presidential limit prevents long-term incumbency and encourages leadership renewal at the top.

### 8. Member Petition for Special Meetings: 15% Threshold
TAAGNY allows special membership meetings to be called by written petition of 15% of regular members in good standing. SCUT Alumni America requires a majority Board vote. The petition mechanism gives members a meaningful democratic check against an unresponsive Board.

### 9. Explicit Financial Review by CPA
TAAGNY's bylaws authorize the Board to engage an independent CPA for annual financial statement review. SCUT Alumni America has no such provision. Independent financial review is particularly important for a larger organization and helps maintain donor and member trust.

### 10. NAFTHAA Relationship Article
TAAGNY's bylaws include a dedicated article defining its relationship with NAFTHAA (the North America Federation of Tsinghua Alumni Associations). SCUT Alumni America's bylaws make no reference to any federated or umbrella relationship with other SCUT alumni associations. If SCUT Alumni America participates in or coordinates with any national or international SCUT alumni network, this relationship should be defined in the bylaws.

### 11. Industry-Based Networking Committees
TAAGNY's committee structure includes a Technology and Industry Networking committee that organizes events by industry sector—a sophisticated and practical committee specifically tailored to the diverse professional backgrounds of SJTU/Tsinghua alumni. SCUT Alumni America does not have a committee structure at all.

### 12. Young Alumni Committee
TAAGNY dedicates a standing committee specifically to recent graduates and students, with mentorship programs. SCUT Alumni America has no committee structure and no specific provision for young alumni. This is a critical gap: recent graduates are the lifeblood of any alumni association.

## What SCUT Alumni America Can Learn from TAAGNY

### Highest Priority

1. **Differentiate Vice Chairman roles by portfolio.** Rather than having "up to six Vice Chairmen" with undefined roles, assign each Vice Chairman a specific portfolio: e.g., Vice Chairman for Events, Vice Chairman for Membership, Vice Chairman for Finance Oversight, Vice Chairman for Young Alumni, Vice Chairman for SCUT Liaison. This clarifies responsibilities and provides clear accountability.

2. **Add a Young Alumni and New Arrival Committee.** Creating a dedicated committee for recently graduated SCUT alumni and newly arrived SCUT alumni in the US would dramatically improve the organization's relevance and growth. This committee should run mentorship programs and welcome new arrivals.

3. **Limit the Chairman/President to two consecutive terms.** This is a governance best practice that TAAGNY's longevity validates. Leadership renewal at the top prevents organizational stagnation.

4. **Add a member petition mechanism for special meetings.** A 10–15% membership petition threshold gives members a meaningful voice when the Board is unresponsive.

### Secondary Priorities

5. **Authorize independent financial review.** Engaging a CPA for annual financial statement review is appropriate for any organization above a minimal size. Adding this authorization to the bylaws signals financial accountability to members and donors.

6. **Define the organization's relationship to any SCUT alumni networks.** If there is a global SCUT alumni association or a relationship with SCUT's Alumni Affairs Office, this relationship should be acknowledged and defined in the bylaws.

7. **Consider President-specific term limits distinct from Director term limits.** Following TAAGNY's model, a President limited to two consecutive terms may continue serving as a Director beyond that.

## Summary Assessment

TAAGNY represents what SCUT Alumni America could become with four decades of organizational development: a large, well-governed, financially accountable 501(c)(3) alumni association with functional committee structure, differentiated leadership roles, and federation membership. The most actionable lessons from TAAGNY for SCUT's immediate revision are: (1) differentiate Vice Chairman portfolios; (2) create a Young Alumni and New Arrival program; (3) limit the Chairman to two consecutive terms; (4) add member petition rights; and (5) increase minimum Board meeting frequency. These changes, which together represent a significant but achievable governance upgrade, would position SCUT Alumni America to serve its members more effectively and to grow sustainably over the next decades.
