# Analysis Report: PUAASC vs. SCUT Alumni America

**Organization:** Peking University Alumni Association of Southern California (PUAASC)
**SCUT Baseline:** South China University of Technology Alumni, America (By-Laws adopted December 10, 2002)

---

## Overview

PUAASC and SCUT Alumni America are among the most directly comparable organizations in this example set. Both are California nonprofit corporations serving Chinese university alumni in the United States, both were established in the 1990s–2000s, and both operate with a Board-of-Directors governance structure, elected Chairman, and similar officer roles. Studying PUAASC's approach illuminates both what SCUT's bylaws do well and where modernization may be warranted.

## Similarities

### 1. Legal Form
Both are California nonprofit corporations serving a regional membership of Chinese university alumni. Both are governed by California nonprofit law. The mutual benefit corporation structure means neither is primarily organized for tax-deductible fundraising but rather for the mutual benefit of members.

### 2. Purposes
The purpose clauses are nearly identical in their aspirations: promoting communication among alumni, supporting professional development, strengthening ties to the home university, and enhancing the university's reputation. Both organizations are explicitly non-profit and non-political.

### 3. Governance Structure
Both use a Board of Directors as the supreme governing body, with an elected Chairman (equivalent to President in other organizations), Vice Chairmen, Secretary, and Treasurer. Both vest authority in the Board to appoint officers and plan activities.

### 4. Membership Eligibility
Both require that members have studied or worked at their respective Chinese universities and reside or work in the United States (or a defined geographic region). Both establish that members may vote and be elected to the Board.

### 5. Quorum Rules
Both require majority of the authorized number of directors for a quorum at Board meetings, and both allow majority-present decisions for routine matters.

### 6. Amendment Threshold
Both require a two-thirds (2/3) majority for bylaw amendments, a standard high-threshold protection for foundational rules.

### 7. Officer Appointment vs. Election
Both distinguish between elected positions (Chairman, Vice Chairmen, elected by the Board from among Directors) and appointed positions (Secretary and Treasurer, appointed by the Board).

## Differences

### 1. Geographic Scope
PUAASC defines its geographic area explicitly as six Southern California counties (Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura). SCUT Alumni America's bylaws cover "America" broadly without a defined sub-region, which is appropriate for a national scope but may benefit from clarification about how nationwide members are served or whether regional sub-chapters are contemplated.

### 2. Board Size Range
PUAASC sets the Board at 9–21 Directors, giving greater flexibility. SCUT Alumni America sets 11–21 Directors, with a higher minimum. SCUT's current minimum of 11 could be operationally challenging if membership or volunteer engagement declines; PUAASC's lower minimum of 9 offers more resilience.

### 3. Notice Period for Membership Meetings
PUAASC requires fourteen (14) days' notice for membership meetings. SCUT Alumni America requires only one (1) week. In practice, fourteen days gives members more time to plan attendance and is more consistent with modern organizational practice.

### 4. Standing Committees
PUAASC explicitly provides for a committee structure with examples of standing committees (Events, Membership, Finance, Scholarship, Communications). SCUT Alumni America's bylaws have no committee provisions whatsoever—a significant gap that limits the Board's ability to delegate work and engage members beyond the Board itself.

### 5. Dissolution Clause
PUAASC includes an explicit dissolution clause specifying that remaining assets shall be distributed to similar nonprofit organizations and that no assets shall inure to any member. SCUT Alumni America's bylaws contain no dissolution provision, creating a potential legal and governance gap.

### 6. Indemnification
PUAASC includes an indemnification clause protecting Directors and officers acting in good faith. SCUT Alumni America has no such provision. This is a significant gap: without indemnification language, it may be difficult to recruit qualified individuals to serve on the Board.

### 7. Director Term Limits
PUAASC does not specify term limits for Directors. SCUT Alumni America also does not set term limits, which can be both a strength (continuity of institutional knowledge) and a weakness (potential entrenchment).

### 8. Electronic Voting (Membership Level)
Both permit electronic voting for Board elections, but PUAASC is more explicit about the electronic ballot window and process. SCUT Alumni America references electronic voting but provides fewer procedural details.

### 9. Absent Director Removal
Both provide that Directors absent from three consecutive meetings without excuse are considered to have resigned. This rule is identical in spirit.

### 10. Action Without Meeting
PUAASC's bylaws (and standard California nonprofit practice) allow Board action by unanimous written consent without a meeting. SCUT Alumni America's bylaws are silent on this point.

## What SCUT Alumni America Can Learn from PUAASC

### Highest Priority

1. **Add a dissolution clause.** Any nonprofit should specify what happens to its assets upon dissolution. Distributing assets to similar organizations is both legally sound and consistent with nonprofit principles.

2. **Add an indemnification clause.** Protecting Directors and officers from personal liability for good-faith actions in their organizational roles is standard practice and essential for recruiting qualified board members.

3. **Establish a committee framework.** Even a basic provision authorizing the Board to create committees—and naming a few standing committees—would vastly improve the Association's operational capacity. Currently, all organizational work must flow through the full Board, which creates bottlenecks and limits engagement.

### Secondary Priorities

4. **Extend meeting notice periods.** Moving from one week to two weeks for membership meetings improves member participation and is more consistent with modern practice.

5. **Add action-without-meeting authorization.** Allowing the Board to act by unanimous written consent is a practical necessity for a volunteer organization where scheduling in-person meetings can be challenging.

6. **Clarify the geographic scope.** While SCUT Alumni America is national in scope, the bylaws should be explicit about whether the organization serves all of America uniformly or whether there is regional structure.

7. **Consider a lower Board minimum.** Reducing the minimum Board size from 11 to 9 would provide more operational flexibility.

## Summary Assessment

PUAASC's bylaws represent a moderately more comprehensive governance document than SCUT Alumni America's 2002 bylaws, incorporating several provisions—dissolution, indemnification, committees, electronic action—that reflect the development of nonprofit best practices since 2002. The core governance philosophy is essentially identical. SCUT Alumni America can use PUAASC as a near-peer reference point, as the organizations share the same legal form, mission type, and community orientation.
