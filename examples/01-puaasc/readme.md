# Peking University Alumni Association of Southern California (PUAASC)

## Overview

The **Peking University Alumni Association of Southern California (PUAASC)** is a nonprofit organization serving alumni of Peking University (北京大学, also known as Beida) who reside or work in the greater Southern California region. PUAASC is incorporated in the State of California and operates in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, Orange County, and surrounding counties.

## History and Background

PUAASC was established in the 1990s as the alumni presence from Peking University in California grew alongside the wave of Chinese academic and professional immigration to the United States. Peking University, founded in 1898, is one of China's two most prestigious universities (alongside Tsinghua University) and consistently ranks among Asia's top research institutions. The Southern California chapter was one of the first regional alumni associations formed by Peking University graduates in the United States.

The association has grown to become one of the most active and prominent Chinese university alumni organizations on the West Coast, regularly hosting academic forums, professional networking events, cultural celebrations, and community outreach activities.

## Mission and Purposes

PUAASC is dedicated to:

- Fostering friendship, camaraderie, and mutual support among Beida alumni in Southern California
- Promoting professional networking, career development, and entrepreneurship among members
- Facilitating academic and intellectual exchange between Southern California and Peking University
- Supporting Peking University's educational mission through fundraising and advocacy
- Preserving and promoting Chinese cultural heritage in the Southern California Chinese-American community
- Serving as a bridge between Peking University's administration and its alumni diaspora in the region

## Organizational Character

PUAASC is a non-political, non-religious nonprofit organization. It is structured as a California Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation, operating with an elected Board of Directors that governs the organization. Members include graduates and faculty of Peking University residing in Southern California.

## Membership and Geographic Scope

Membership is open to individuals who graduated from or were faculty of Peking University and who reside, study, or work in the greater Southern California area (generally encompassing Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura counties).
