# OCA – Asian Pacific American Advocates (OCA National)

## Overview

**OCA – Asian Pacific American Advocates** (formerly the **Organization of Chinese Americans**, commonly known as **OCA**) is a national 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization headquartered in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1973, OCA is a member-driven civil rights and advocacy organization with over 50 chapters and affiliates across the United States. While broader in scope than a university alumni association, OCA represents an important governance model for Chinese-American and Asian Pacific American nonprofit organizations, with over five decades of organizational history and a mature, convention-based governance structure.

## History and Background

OCA was founded in **1973** by K.L. Wang and Alex Mark, along with other Chinese Americans who sought to create a unified voice for Chinese Americans in the civil rights movement. The first National Convention was held on **June 9, 1973**, in Washington D.C., where 112 delegates from across the nation attended. At that convention, the constitution, bylaws, and the name of the organization were formally adopted—establishing OCA as one of the first national Chinese-American advocacy nonprofits in the United States.

The original three chapters were in Washington D.C., Detroit, and St. Louis. Over the following decades, OCA grew to include chapters across the country serving Chinese Americans and, increasingly, the broader Asian Pacific American community. In **2013**, reflecting the growing diversity of the AAPI community, the organization rebranded from "Organization of Chinese Americans" to "OCA – Asian Pacific American Advocates" to explicitly advocate on behalf of all Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders.

## Mission and Purposes

OCA's mission is to advance the social, political, and economic well-being of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) in the United States. Specific programmatic priorities include:

- Civil rights advocacy for AAPIs at the federal, state, and local levels
- Leadership development for young Asian American professionals
- Professional development programs and mentorship
- Voter education and civic engagement
- Combating discrimination, hate crimes, and inaccurate media portrayals
- Immigration advocacy and support for immigrant communities
- Educational access and scholarship programs

## Organizational Character

OCA is a **501(c)(3) national member-driven nonprofit**. It operates through a national center in Washington D.C. and relies on its network of more than 50 chapters and affiliates that operate as independent nonprofits. The organization's governance combines national convention democracy (delegates from chapters) with a national board structure.

## Governance Structure

OCA's governance model is notable for its scale and convention-based structure:
- **National Convention:** The supreme governing body of OCA; delegates from local chapters convene annually (or periodically) to vote on policy positions, elections, and constitutional amendments
- **National Board of Directors:** Governs the organization between conventions
- **Executive Director:** Senior professional staff leader; the organization is one of few Chinese-American nonprofits with dedicated professional staff
- **Chapters:** Over 50 independent chapters and affiliates that operate their own governance and programs under OCA's national framework

## Membership

OCA operates on a membership model at both the individual and chapter level. Individual members join through local chapters, which are affiliated with the national organization. Members participate in local chapter activities and send delegates to the national convention.

## Distinction from Alumni Associations

OCA differs from university alumni associations in several key respects:
- It serves a broad demographic (all AAPIs) rather than alumni of a specific institution
- Its primary mission is civil rights advocacy rather than alumni networking
- It has professional staff and a significant operating budget
- Its governance uses a national convention/delegate model

Nevertheless, OCA's long-established nonprofit governance framework, its chapter structure, its amendment procedures, and its experience balancing national coordination with local chapter autonomy provide valuable reference points for any Chinese-American nonprofit considering organizational modernization.
