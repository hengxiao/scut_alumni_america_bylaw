# Analysis Report: OCA National vs. SCUT Alumni America

**Organization:** OCA – Asian Pacific American Advocates (OCA National)
**SCUT Baseline:** South China University of Technology Alumni, America (By-Laws adopted December 10, 2002)

---

## Overview

OCA – Asian Pacific American Advocates (formerly the Organization of Chinese Americans) is structurally the most different from SCUT Alumni America in this example set: it is a national advocacy and civil rights organization founded in 1973, serves a broad AAPI community rather than alumni of a specific university, has professional staff, and operates through a national convention model rather than a single membership association. Despite these differences, OCA's governance model offers highly valuable lessons for SCUT Alumni America, particularly as a case study in what organizational maturity looks like after five decades of operation, how chapter systems can be governed, how a national convention serves as the supreme democratic body, and how a professional staff model differs from an all-volunteer model.

## Similarities

### 1. Chinese-American Roots and Constituency
OCA was originally founded to serve Chinese Americans, and its historical governance documents reflect a community deeply overlapping with SCUT Alumni America's membership. While OCA has since broadened to serve all AAPIs, its original constituency and organizational culture reflect the same Chinese-American community from which SCUT Alumni America draws.

### 2. Non-Profit, Non-Partisan Character
Both are non-profit organizations that explicitly prohibit partisan political activity, though OCA engages in substantial civic advocacy (voter registration, civil rights) that goes beyond SCUT Alumni America's scope.

### 3. National Scope with Formal Governance
Both organizations serve a national membership (SCUT Alumni America: all of America; OCA: 50+ chapters across the US). Both have formal governance structures designed to provide organizational accountability at scale.

### 4. Annual Gathering as Major Governance Event
OCA's Annual National Convention is the supreme governing body—all major decisions, elections, and constitutional amendments happen there. SCUT Alumni America's annual membership meeting similarly combines governance (elections, amendments) with community (activities review, fellowship). The convention model reflects a common instinct: anchor governance in a periodic gathering of the community.

### 5. Supermajority for Constitutional Amendment
OCA requires a two-thirds vote of delegates at the Convention to amend the Constitution. SCUT Alumni America requires a two-thirds member vote for bylaw amendments. Both use the two-thirds standard as a high bar for changing foundational rules.

### 6. Chapter and Sub-Group Provisions
OCA has an extensive chapter framework with chartering requirements, obligations, and revocation procedures. While SCUT Alumni America currently has no chapter structure, OCA's framework is the most detailed model in this example set for how a national alumni or membership organization could govern its local chapters.

## Differences

### 1. Mission and Constituency Scope
| Dimension | SCUT Alumni America | OCA National |
|---|---|---|
| Primary constituency | SCUT alumni in America | All Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders |
| Primary purpose | Alumni fellowship and university connection | Civil rights, advocacy, leadership development |
| Membership basis | University alumni | Any AAPI person or ally |
| Activities | Networking, events, university liaison | Advocacy, voter education, leadership programs |
| IRS status | 501(c)(7) social club | 501(c)(3) charitable |

### 2. Professional Staff vs. All-Volunteer
OCA National employs an Executive Director and professional staff. The bylaws include a dedicated article defining the Executive Director's role, accountability to the Board, and separation from the Board (non-voting). SCUT Alumni America is entirely volunteer-driven with no paid staff.

This distinction matters for bylaw design: organizations with staff need governance provisions that define the staff's authority, accountability, and relationship to elected leadership. For now, SCUT Alumni America does not need these provisions, but as it grows, it may need to consider whether to hire professional staff (e.g., for events coordination, membership management, or bookkeeping) and how to govern the staff relationship.

### 3. Delegate-Based Convention vs. Direct-Member Meeting
OCA's supreme governing body is a delegate convention where chapters send proportional representatives. SCUT Alumni America's supreme governing body is a direct membership meeting where individual members vote. The convention model:
- Is appropriate for organizations where members are geographically dispersed and chapters have formal standing
- Provides structured representation for local communities
- Requires formal chapter chartering and delegate processes
- Can be more democratic at the local level while being less directly democratic at the national level

SCUT Alumni America's direct membership meeting model is appropriate for its current structure but would need to evolve if the organization adopts a chapter structure.

### 4. Larger Board Range (Up to 25) with Officer + Chapter + At-Large Directors
OCA's Board includes national officers, chapter representatives, and at-large Directors—three distinct streams of representation. SCUT Alumni America's Board consists only of directly elected alumni Directors. OCA's multi-stream model ensures that: (1) top officers have governance voice; (2) geographic chapters are represented; (3) at-large voices reflecting particular expertise or constituencies can be included.

### 5. Extended Amendment Notice Periods: 90 Days / 45 Days
OCA requires proposed amendments to be submitted to the Board 90 days before the Convention and circulated to members 45 days before. SCUT Alumni America requires only 30 days' notice. OCA's longer timeline reflects the complexity of a national organization with chapters needing time to educate their members and formulate delegate positions. For a national organization like SCUT Alumni America, 30 days may be sufficient, but extending to 45 days would be more respectful of members' need to consider amendments.

### 6. Emergency Amendment Mechanism
OCA provides for emergency between-convention amendments by a three-fourths (3/4) Board vote, subject to Convention ratification. SCUT Alumni America has no equivalent mechanism for urgent bylaw changes between annual meetings. This is a practical governance gap: what happens if a bylaw provision creates a legal problem that must be fixed before the next annual meeting?

### 7. Annual CPA Audit Requirement
OCA's bylaws require an annual independent CPA audit. SCUT Alumni America has no such provision. For an organization with significant revenue or public donations, an annual audit is a critical accountability mechanism.

### 8. Chapter Revocation Process
OCA's bylaws specify that the Board can revoke a chapter charter for cause by a two-thirds vote. If SCUT Alumni America adopts a chapter structure, it will need equivalent provisions for managing non-compliant or inactive chapters.

### 9. President Term Limits
OCA limits national officers to two consecutive terms in the same office. SCUT Alumni America has no officer term limits. The two-term presidential limit is a widely adopted governance best practice.

## What SCUT Alumni America Can Learn from OCA

### Strategic/Long-Term Lessons

1. **Draft for future chapter structure.** Even if SCUT Alumni America does not immediately adopt a chapter structure, the bylaws should be drafted to accommodate future chapters. Key provisions needed:
   - Chapter chartering requirements (minimum members, geographic area, etc.)
   - Chapter obligations (reporting, dues to national, delegate attendance)
   - Chapter revocation procedure
   - Chapter representation on the national Board

2. **Consider a dedicated article for any future staff.** If SCUT Alumni America hires professional staff (even part-time bookkeeper or events coordinator), the bylaws should address the Executive Director or staff coordinator role, reporting relationships, and the boundary between staff authority and Board authority.

3. **Plan for organizational maturity.** OCA's evolution from a 1973 conference of 112 Chinese Americans to a 50-chapter national organization took decades. SCUT Alumni America's bylaw revision should design governance structures that can scale gracefully—lower Board minimums, flexible Director count ranges, committee frameworks, chapter provisions—rather than provisions that will need to be completely rewritten as the organization grows.

### Immediate Governance Lessons

4. **Add an emergency amendment mechanism.** Allowing the Board to adopt urgently needed amendments (e.g., for legal compliance) by a 3/4 or unanimous vote, subject to member ratification at the next annual meeting, provides important operational flexibility.

5. **Extend amendment notice periods.** Moving from 30 to 45 days' notice for proposed bylaw amendments gives members more meaningful time to evaluate changes.

6. **Implement officer term limits.** OCA's two-consecutive-term limit for officers, combined with the ability to continue serving as a Director, is a best practice SCUT Alumni America should adopt.

7. **Consider a formal provision for a Young Leaders or Next Generation program.** OCA's extensive youth and leadership development programming is one of the organization's signature contributions. For SCUT Alumni America, a formal Young Alumni program—even just naming it as a standing committee in the bylaws—would signal investment in the next generation of organizational leaders.

## Summary Assessment

OCA and SCUT Alumni America are at dramatically different stages of organizational development: OCA is a 52-year-old, professionally staffed, nationally federated advocacy organization; SCUT Alumni America is a volunteer alumni association with bylaws last updated in 2002. The direct applicability of OCA's specific governance provisions is limited by the structural differences. However, OCA provides an inspiring model of what a Chinese-American nonprofit can become with sustained commitment, and its governance provisions—particularly the chapter framework, the emergency amendment mechanism, the officer term limits, and the extended notice periods—offer concrete improvements SCUT Alumni America can adopt now. Most importantly, OCA demonstrates that starting from a modest community meeting (112 delegates in 1973), a Chinese-American organization can build durable, trusted national institutions over decades—a trajectory SCUT Alumni America can aspire to.
