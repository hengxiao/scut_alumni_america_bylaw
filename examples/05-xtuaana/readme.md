# Xiangtan University Alumni Association of North America (XTUAANA)

## Overview

The **Xiangtan University Alumni Association of North America (XTUAANA)** is a nonprofit organization incorporated in the State of California as a **Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation**, serving alumni of Xiangtan University (湘潭大学) who reside or work in North America. XTUAANA is one of the most structurally analogous organizations to SCUT Alumni America, sharing a nearly identical legal form, governance structure, and purpose profile.

## History and Background

Xiangtan University (湘潭大学) is a comprehensive public university located in Xiangtan, Hunan Province, China. It was founded in 1958 with the personal support of Mao Zedong, who was born in Xiangtan County. The university is known for its research in science, engineering, literature, and economics, and has a strong alumni presence in Hunan Province and across China.

XTUAANA was established to serve the growing North American community of Xiangtan University graduates. Alumni of Xiangtan University in North America are concentrated in university towns and technology centers across the United States and Canada, with active members in the Bay Area, Southern California, New York, and other metropolitan regions.

## Mission and Purposes

XTUAANA was organized and operates for the following purposes:

- To promote communication and friendship among Xiangtan University alumni in North America
- To promote professional development and personal growth for members
- To provide opportunities for members to share and strengthen their common interests and bonds

## Organizational Character

XTUAANA is a non-profit, non-political organization.

- Proposals must be announced 30 days before the annual membership meeting
- Adoption requires a two-thirds majority vote
