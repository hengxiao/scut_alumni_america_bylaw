# Harvard Chinese Students & Scholars Association (HCSSA)

## Overview

The **Harvard Chinese Students & Scholars Association (HCSSA)** is the largest student organization at Harvard University and one of the most prominent Chinese student associations in the United States. Founded in 1994, HCSSA is dedicated to promoting social, intellectual, and cultural activities for Chinese students and scholars at Harvard University and for other interested members of the Harvard community. Unlike the other examples in this collection, HCSSA is a university-affiliated student organization rather than an independent nonprofit, but it maintains a formally adopted Constitution and Bylaws and governs itself through a structured democratic process.

## History and Background

HCSSA was founded in 1994, marking three decades of continuous operation as of 2024. It has grown to become the largest recognized student group at Harvard, reflecting both the large number of Chinese students across Harvard's schools and the strength of community it has built over the years. The organization operates across all Harvard schools and campuses, including the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard Business School, Harvard Law School, Harvard Medical School, the Kennedy School, and others.

In 2023, HCSSA adopted an amended and restated Constitution and Bylaws, reflecting governance modernization for a large, complex student organization. The constitution is publicly available on HCSSA's website, making it a transparent model for other Chinese academic organizations.

## Mission and Purposes

HCSSA's mission is to:

- Promote social, intellectual, and cultural activities for Chinese students and scholars at Harvard University
- Provide community and mutual support for Chinese students and scholars at Harvard
- Serve as a bridge between Chinese and other communities within Harvard and in the greater Boston area
- Celebrate Chinese culture, language, and traditions within the Harvard community
- Support professional and academic development of Chinese students and scholars

HCSSA is non-political and does not engage in partisan activity.

## Membership

Membership is open to any student or scholar in the Harvard community who has an interest in HCSSA's mission. Any HCSSA member with a valid Harvard University email address is eligible to vote in elections. The organization intentionally maintains an open-door membership policy consistent with Harvard University's non-discrimination policies.

## Governance Structure

HCSSA is governed by an **Executive Board** consisting of:
- **President:** Chief executive officer; must have served as an HCSSA officer for at least two prior terms; runs as a ticket with the Vice President
- **Vice President(s):** Assist the President; assume office temporarily if President vacates
- **Secretary:** Maintains minutes and official documents
- **Treasurer:** Manages financial records and applies for funding
- **Committee Chairs and Fellows:** Responsible for specific functional areas (e.g., events, academic, cultural, career, community service)

Officers are elected annually before the end of the spring semester, by eligible members. Candidates for President and Vice President must run as a team and must receive a majority of votes. If no candidate receives a majority, a runoff is held between the top two vote-getters. Additional officers may be elected to fill vacancies at general meetings.

## Committees

HCSSA operates through multiple committees, each led by a Committee Chair (who may not chair more than one committee simultaneously). Additional volunteers may join committees but are not recognized as official officers. The Executive Board may add or remove committees by majority vote.

## Distinction from Alumni Associations

HCSSA differs from alumni associations in several important ways:
- It is a current-student organization rather than a post-graduation alumni body
- It is not an independent nonprofit but operates under Harvard University's student organization framework
- Membership is defined by current enrollment/affiliation rather than by alumnus status
- Officers serve one-year terms (vs. multi-year terms in many alumni associations)

Despite these differences, HCSSA's constitution offers valuable governance models, particularly around officer election procedures, runoff mechanisms, committee structure, and constitutional amendment processes.
