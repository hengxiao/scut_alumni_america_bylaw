# University of Science and Technology of China Alumni Foundation (USTCAF)

## Overview

The **University of Science and Technology of China Alumni Foundation (USTCAF)** is a nonprofit foundation incorporated in the State of Delaware and holding IRS 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status since 1999. USTCAF serves the global community of alumni from the University of Science and Technology of China (中国科学技术大学, commonly abbreviated USTC or 中科大), one of China's most elite research universities. The foundation's current mailing address is in Santa Clara, California.

## History and Background

USTCAF was formally established in the 1990s, growing out of informal networks of USTC alumni in North America. The University of Science and Technology of China, founded in 1958 under the auspices of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is particularly well-known for its science and engineering programs and has produced a large number of researchers, professors, and technology professionals worldwide.

The foundation obtained IRS 501(c)(3) status in 1999, formally establishing itself as a charitable organization. Over its history, the organization has adopted and revised its bylaws multiple times (1995, 2002, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2016), demonstrating a mature governance culture. The 2016 Amended and Restated Bylaws represent the current governing document.

## Mission and Purposes

USTCAF's mission is to:

- Promote the excellence of the USTC community, including current students, faculty, and alumni worldwide
- Promote academic and cultural exchange between USTC and researchers and institutions worldwide
- Provide scholarships and financial support to deserving USTC students
- Support USTC's educational programs and research initiatives
- Build and sustain a high-quality alumni network for the benefit of members and the university

## Organizational Character

USTCAF is deliberately structured as an **All Volunteer Organization (AVO)**. It employs no paid staff, keeping its operating costs below 1% of revenue and directing almost all donations to its programs. The foundation is explicitly independent of USTC and independent of any USTC alumni association, reinforcing its role as a neutral, mission-driven charitable entity.

## Governance Structure

USTCAF is governed by a **Governing Board (GB)** of up to twenty (20) members. The organization also has a three-member **Executive Committee (EC)** composed of a Chairperson, a Vice-Chair, and a Secretary, who supervise day-to-day management and represent USTCAF externally. Several standing committees support specific functions including:
- Membership and Alumni Services
- Fund-raising
- Finance
- Publicity and Communication
- USTC Liaison
- Scholarship

## Membership

Unlike some alumni associations that base membership on simply having attended the university, USTCAF's membership is tied to financial contribution. A member at any given time is someone who has made a donation pledge of $20 or more in the preceding 365 days (with payment remitted within 30 days), OR has paid annual membership dues of $10 in the preceding 365 days, OR has been designated a "lifetime member." Members must also execute a membership agreement.

## Programs and Activities

USTCAF's primary focus is its scholarship program, which has funded numerous awards for outstanding USTC students. The foundation also supports educational exchange, lectures, and alumni networking events. Its lean volunteer model ensures that virtually all donations are directed to these programs rather than administrative overhead.
