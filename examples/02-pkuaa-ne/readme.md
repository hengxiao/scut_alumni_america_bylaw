# Peking University Alumni Association of New England (PKUAA-NE)

## Overview

The **Peking University Alumni Association of New England, Inc. (PKUAA-NE)** is a nonprofit organization incorporated in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, serving Peking University alumni who reside or work throughout the New England region, including Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. The organization holds IRS 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, meaning it operates for charitable and educational purposes and donations to it are tax-deductible.

## History and Background

PKUAA-NE was formed by Peking University alumni concentrated in the greater Boston area, home to some of the world's leading research universities and a hub for biotechnology, finance, and higher education. The density of Peking University graduates in the Boston metropolitan area—drawn by institutions such as Harvard, MIT, Tufts, Boston University, and the many hospitals and biotech firms of the Kendall Square corridor—made New England a natural locus for an active alumni chapter.

The association became incorporated as a formal nonprofit, distinguishing it from more informal alumni networks. Its 501(c)(3) designation reflects a mission oriented toward charitable purposes: cultural exchange, educational promotion, and community service, rather than the social club model (501(c)(7)) adopted by some peer organizations.

## Mission and Purposes

Per its governing documents, PKUAA-NE is organized and operated exclusively for charitable, religious, educational, and/or scientific purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Its specific purposes are:

- To promote cultural understanding and educational exchanges between the peoples of the United States and the People's Republic of China
- To build and strengthen the Peking University alumni network in New England
- To support the academic and professional development of Peking University alumni in the region
- To assist newly arrived alumni and students in their transition to life in the United States
- To organize scholarly, cultural, and social events for the benefit of members and the broader community

## Organizational Character

PKUAA-NE is a nonprofit public benefit corporation governed by a Board of Directors. As a 501(c)(3) organization, it is prohibited from distributing income to its members and is subject to restrictions on political activity. The board-member-driven governance model ensures accountability and stability in organizational leadership.

## Amendment of Bylaws

PKUAA-NE's bylaws may be altered, amended, or repealed by approval of: (i) two-thirds (2/3) of the Board of Directors, or (ii) a majority of the registered members in good standing. This dual-track amendment pathway provides both flexibility for the board and meaningful participation rights for the membership.

## Membership

Membership in PKUAA-NE is open to graduates and former faculty of Peking University who reside or work in the New England region. Members in good standing are entitled to vote at general membership meetings and to participate in all association programs and events.

## Relationship with Peer Organizations

PKUAA-NE coordinates with other regional Peking University alumni associations across North America, including PUAASC (Southern California), PKUAANC (Northern California), the national-level Peking University Educational Foundation USA, and Peking University's Alumni Affairs Office in Beijing.
