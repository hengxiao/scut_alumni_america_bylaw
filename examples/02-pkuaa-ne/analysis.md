# Analysis Report: PKUAA-NE vs. SCUT Alumni America

**Organization:** Peking University Alumni Association of New England, Inc. (PKUAA-NE)
**SCUT Baseline:** South China University of Technology Alumni, America (By-Laws adopted December 10, 2002)

---

## Overview

PKUAA-NE and SCUT Alumni America share the same core mission—serving Chinese university alumni in the United States—but differ in one critical legal dimension: PKUAA-NE holds IRS 501(c)(3) status (charitable and educational purpose corporation), while SCUT Alumni America operates as an IRS 501(c)(7) social club (mutual benefit). This distinction has broad implications for governance, fundraising, and accountability. PKUAA-NE therefore serves as a valuable reference point for SCUT if the organization is considering re-evaluating its IRS classification, and as a model of 501(c)(3)-caliber governance practices that 501(c)(7) organizations may nonetheless wish to adopt.

## Similarities

### 1. Mission Alignment
Both organizations exist to serve alumni of prestigious Chinese universities in the United States. Both emphasize fellowship, professional development, connection to the home university, and cultural exchange. The core "why" of both organizations is essentially identical.

### 2. Membership Eligibility Based on University Affiliation
Both define membership primarily by having graduated from, studied at, or been employed by a specific Chinese university.

### 3. Annual Membership Meeting
Both hold an annual membership meeting that includes elections of directors and review of organizational activities.

### 4. Board-Centric Governance
Both organizations vest primary governance authority in a Board of Directors, which in turn appoints or elects officers. The Chairman/President model and the Secretary/Treasurer roles are shared.

### 5. Amendment by Supermajority
Both require a two-thirds supermajority for bylaw amendment, providing protection for foundational governance rules.

### 6. Non-Profit, Non-Political
Both explicitly prohibit distribution of assets to members and prohibit partisan political activity.

## Differences

### 1. IRS Classification: 501(c)(7) vs. 501(c)(3)
This is the most fundamental structural difference:

| Dimension | SCUT Alumni America (501(c)(7)) | PKUAA-NE (501(c)(3)) |
|---|---|---|
| Primary purpose | Social/recreational benefit to members | Charitable/educational/cultural benefit to community |
| Tax-deductibility of donations | No | Yes |
| Fundraising capacity | Limited | Can solicit tax-deductible donations |
| Public accountability | Lower | Higher (must file Form 990) |
| Restrictions on private benefit | Moderate | Strict |
| Revenue limits | Most income must come from members | No such restriction |

For SCUT Alumni America, this comparison raises the policy question: Is the Association primarily serving its members' social interests (501(c)(7)), or does it also serve a broader educational and cultural purpose (501(c)(3))? If the organization wants to expand fundraising for scholarships, university support, or community programs, the 501(c)(3) model may be worth considering.

### 2. Director Term Limits
PKUAA-NE explicitly limits Directors to three (3) consecutive terms before a mandatory gap. SCUT Alumni America has no term limits. Term limits prevent entrenchment, encourage fresh leadership, and reduce the risk that a small group dominates governance over many years.

### 3. Director Terms: 2 Years vs. 3 Years
PKUAA-NE sets two-year Director terms. SCUT Alumni America has three-year terms. Two-year terms allow more frequent member input into Board composition; three-year terms provide more stability and continuity. The optimal choice depends on the organization's culture and the availability of engaged members.

### 4. Special Meeting Trigger
PKUAA-NE permits special membership meetings to be called by written petition of twenty percent (20%) of members in good standing. SCUT Alumni America requires a majority Board vote—a much higher threshold that can suppress legitimate membership-driven action. A petition-based mechanism is more democratic and provides an important check on Board authority.

### 5. Notice Periods: 21 Days vs. 7 Days
PKUAA-NE requires 21 days' notice for membership meetings; SCUT requires only 7 days. Twenty-one days is significantly more inclusive of geographically dispersed members.

### 6. Action Without Meeting
PKUAA-NE's bylaws allow the Board to act by unanimous written consent without a formal meeting. SCUT Alumni America's bylaws are silent on this point, which can create unnecessary delays in time-sensitive decisions.

### 7. Explicit Financial Controls
PKUAA-NE specifies a disbursement threshold (not less than $500) below which two-signature requirements may not apply, and allows the Board to engage an independent accountant. SCUT Alumni America only states that two signatures are needed for withdrawals, without further financial control detail.

### 8. Annual Financial Review
PKUAA-NE explicitly authorizes the Board to engage an independent accountant to review financial statements. This strengthens financial accountability without requiring a full audit, which can be expensive for a small nonprofit.

### 9. Detailed Membership Rights
PKUAA-NE explicitly enumerates what good-standing members are entitled to (voting, nomination rights, access to directories), providing clearer member expectations. SCUT Alumni America states member rights but with less detail.

### 10. Dual Amendment Track
PKUAA-NE offers two pathways for amendment: (i) 2/3 of the Board, or (ii) majority of members in good standing at a membership meeting. SCUT Alumni America requires only membership meeting adoption by 2/3. PKUAA-NE's Board-initiated track makes procedural housekeeping amendments more efficient; SCUT's members-only track gives members stronger protection from Board overreach.

## What SCUT Alumni America Can Learn from PKUAA-NE

### Highest Priority

1. **Evaluate IRS classification.** The 501(c)(3) vs. 501(c)(7) question is a foundational policy decision. If SCUT Alumni America wants to actively fundraise for scholarships, events co-sponsored with SCUT, or community programs, 501(c)(3) may be more appropriate. If the organization's primary value to members is social networking and fellowship with no significant charitable component, 501(c)(7) remains appropriate.

2. **Add a member petition mechanism for special meetings.** Allowing 15–20% of members to petition for a special meeting gives members a meaningful voice when the Board is unresponsive. This is a democratic safeguard consistent with the organization's stated value of member participation.

3. **Consider Director term limits.** Introducing term limits (e.g., three consecutive terms) would encourage fresh leadership, prevent entrenchment, and broaden governance participation across the membership.

### Secondary Priorities

4. **Extend notice periods.** Extending from 7 to 21 days for membership meetings is more respectful of members' time and reduces the advantage of those closest to leadership.

5. **Add Board action-by-consent provision.** This practical governance tool allows the Board to act promptly without convening a formal meeting in urgent situations.

6. **Define financial control thresholds.** Specifying when two signatures are required (e.g., for disbursements over $500) provides clearer guidance to the Treasurer and prevents disputes.

7. **Authorize independent financial review.** Adding a provision allowing the Board to engage an independent accountant strengthens credibility and is good practice for any organization handling dues and event revenues.

## Summary Assessment

PKUAA-NE's bylaws are more modern and detailed than SCUT Alumni America's 2002 document, reflecting both its different (501(c)(3)) legal status and governance improvements adopted after 2002. The IRS classification question is the most consequential issue SCUT Alumni America should evaluate, as it shapes the entire fundraising and accountability framework. Most of PKUAA-NE's other governance features—term limits, petition rights, longer notice periods, financial controls—can be adopted regardless of IRS classification and would meaningfully strengthen SCUT Alumni America's governance.
