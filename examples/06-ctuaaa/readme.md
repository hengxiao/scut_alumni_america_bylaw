# Chiao Tung University Alumni Association in America (CTUAAA)

## Overview

The **Chiao Tung University Alumni Association in America (CTUAAA)** is a national federation of alumni chapters across the United States and Canada, serving graduates from all five universities that trace their lineage to the original Chiao Tung University (交通大学). These five universities are: Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU), Southwestern Jiaotong University (SWJTU), Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU), and National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU, Taiwan). CTUAAA is a non-political, non-religious, non-profit organization with ten chapters across North America.

## History and Background

The first chapter of CTUAAA was established in **1943** in Los Angeles—making it one of the oldest Chinese university alumni organizations in the United States, predating the founding of the People's Republic of China. It was started by three Chiao Tung University alumni who had emigrated to America. Over the following eight decades, the organization grew into a confederation spanning the entire continent, recognized as one of the most compassionate, well-organized, and influential Chinese alumni associations in America.

The original Chiao Tung University was founded in 1896 in Shanghai and became one of China's most celebrated engineering and technology universities. Following the division of China in 1949, the university's campuses and affiliated institutions spread across the mainland and Taiwan, resulting in the current five-institution family.

## Mission and Purposes

CTUAAA's objectives are:

- To develop the unity of spirit among alumni of all five Chiao Tung Universities
- To initiate and support local chapters across North America
- To coordinate activities and programs common to all chapters
- To help individual chapters carry out their respective objectives
- To promote the further advancement and reputation of the Chiao Tung Universities
- To authorize and coordinate alumni reunions every five years

## Organizational Structure

As a federation, CTUAAA's governance differs significantly from single-institution alumni associations:

- **Board of Directors:** The governing and policy-making body, composed of Directors elected by each Chapter. Chapters with 30–149 members elect one Director; chapters with 150+ members elect two Directors.
- **Chapters:** Each chapter must have at least 30 members and may have sub-branches. All chapter members are automatically members of CTUAAA.
- **Reunion Committee:** Every five years, the Board elects a President and Vice-President of the Reunion at least 18 months in advance. The Board may replace the President or Vice-President by a two-thirds majority vote.
- **Chiao Tung University Alumni Foundation of America, Inc. (CTUAFA):** A separate, duly registered tax-exempt nonprofit that provides scholarships and educational support to students of the five Chiao Tung Universities and their family members.

## Membership

Any graduate of any of the five Chiao Tung Universities is eligible for membership in their respective local CTUAAA chapter. Reunion attendees include members, family members, students, professors, and special guests.

## Chapter Example: Houston

The CTUAA/JTUAA-Houston chapter illustrates the chapter-level governance model: bylaw changes must be proposed by a member, endorsed by at least 10 members, studied by the Executive Committee, and brought to a general meeting within three months of receipt.

## National Significance

CTUAAA is distinctive among Chinese university alumni organizations in the United States for its:
- Eight-decade history as a formalized organization
- Multi-institution, federation model spanning five universities
- Explicit cross-strait (China/Taiwan) membership through NYCU alumni
- National scope with ten chapters across the USA and Canada
