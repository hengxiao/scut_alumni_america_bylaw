# Analysis Report: SJTU-SV vs. SCUT Alumni America

**Organization:** Shanghai Jiao Tong University Alumni Association in Silicon Valley (SJTU-SV)
**SCUT Baseline:** South China University of Technology Alumni, America (By-Laws adopted December 10, 2002)

---

## Overview

SJTU-SV and SCUT Alumni America occupy similar roles in their respective university alumni ecosystems—serving as the primary organizational body for alumni of a leading Chinese engineering and technology university in America—and both share the Silicon Valley/California tech community as a key constituency. SJTU-SV's choice of 501(c)(3) status and its bylaws' treatment of digital-era governance (electronic voting, video conferencing, social media outreach) make it an instructive reference point for SCUT's revision. SJTU-SV also offers useful lessons about small-organization sustainability, as it has maintained active status while operating below the IRS Form 990 filing threshold.

## Similarities

### 1. Serving Alumni of a Major Chinese Engineering University
Both SJTU (established 1896) and SCUT (established 1952) are among China's leading engineering and technology universities, and both have produced significant numbers of graduates who have pursued careers in Silicon Valley and the broader United States. Both organizations serve as community anchors for these alumni.

### 2. California-Based Nonprofit
Both are California nonprofit organizations.

### 3. Technology-Community Focus
Both organizations serve a membership concentrated in technology industries, research, and academia. Both aim to facilitate professional networking among engineers, scientists, and entrepreneurs.

### 4. Board of Directors Governance with Officers
Both use a Board of Directors governance structure with elected Directors and officers (President/Chairman, Vice Presidents/Vice Chairmen, Secretary, Treasurer).

### 5. University Affiliation as Eligibility Criterion
Both define membership based on having graduated from or worked at the respective university.

### 6. Non-Profit, Non-Political Character
Both prohibit asset distribution to members and prohibit partisan political activity.

### 7. Volunteer-Driven Operations
Both organizations are run primarily by volunteers, with no paid professional staff.

## Differences

### 1. Geographic Scope: Regional vs. National
SJTU-SV explicitly serves Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area—a single metro area. SCUT Alumni America serves all of "America." This geographic difference has governance implications:

- SJTU-SV can organize events, meetings, and activities with the assumption that members can attend in person
- SCUT Alumni America must plan for a geographically dispersed national membership
- SCUT's bylaws need to explicitly address how members across the country can meaningfully participate

For SCUT, this comparison highlights the advantage of establishing regional chapters—the Silicon Valley chapter model would be appropriate as one component of a chapter-based national structure.

### 2. IRS Status: 501(c)(3) vs. 501(c)(7)
SJTU-SV holds 501(c)(3) status, meaning contributions to it are tax-deductible. SCUT Alumni America operates as a 501(c)(7) social club. SJTU-SV's 501(c)(3) status enables:
- Soliciting tax-deductible donations for scholarships, events, and university support
- Applying for grants from foundations and corporations
- Greater credibility with donors

### 3. Multiple Membership Categories
SJTU-SV distinguishes between Regular Members, Student Members, Associate Members, and Honorary Members. SCUT Alumni America has a single membership class. The Student Member category—open to current SJTU students visiting or interning in Silicon Valley—is a particularly useful innovation: it builds a pipeline of future engaged alumni while providing support to students during their critical early professional experiences in the US.

### 4. Explicit Term Limits
SJTU-SV limits Directors to three (3) consecutive terms before a required gap. SCUT Alumni America has no term limits, risking entrenchment and reduced leadership renewal.

### 5. Shorter Director Terms: 2 vs. 3 Years
SJTU-SV uses two-year Director terms (with a three-term maximum, giving a maximum of six consecutive years). SCUT uses three-year terms with no limit (potentially allowing indefinite service). Two-year terms allow more frequent member input.

### 6. Four Regular Board Meetings per Year
SJTU-SV requires four regular Board meetings per year. SCUT Alumni America requires only "at least one" Board meeting per year—a remarkably low standard that may reflect the 2002 expectation that the Board would be primarily event-driven. Modern organizational governance expects at least quarterly Board meetings.

### 7. Video Conference Authorization
SJTU-SV explicitly authorizes Board meetings by video conference. SCUT Alumni America's bylaws are silent on electronic meetings. Given that SCUT Alumni America's membership is geographically dispersed across the entire United States, video conferencing is not a luxury—it is essential for any meaningful Board engagement.

### 8. Detailed Committee Structure
SJTU-SV establishes five specific standing committees (Events and Programs, Membership, Finance, Student and Career Development, Outreach and Communications). SCUT Alumni America has no committee provisions. The Student and Career Development Committee is particularly notable: it formalizes mentorship and internship coordination as organizational responsibilities rather than leaving them to informal networks.

### 9. Fiscal Year Specified
SJTU-SV specifies December 31 as the end of its fiscal year. SCUT Alumni America's bylaws do not specify a fiscal year.

### 10. Disbursement Threshold
SJTU-SV specifies that disbursements above $200 require two officer authorizations. SCUT Alumni America requires two signatures for withdrawals without specifying a threshold.

### 11. Substantive Amendment Notice
SJTU-SV provides that "significant amendments affecting member rights or the fundamental purposes of the Association shall also be presented to the general membership for comment before the Board vote." SCUT Alumni America requires member approval but does not provide for a pre-vote comment period. A comment period builds trust and may improve the quality of amendments.

## What SCUT Alumni America Can Learn from SJTU-SV

### Highest Priority

1. **Create a Student Member category.** Opening membership to current SCUT students visiting or interning in the United States is a powerful strategy for building the pipeline of future engaged alumni. These students are at a formative stage of their careers when they most need community support, and welcoming them into the organization creates lasting loyalty.

2. **Increase the minimum Board meeting frequency.** Moving from "at least one" to "at least four" Board meetings per year is a significant governance improvement. Quarterly Board meetings ensure consistent oversight, timely decision-making, and sustained organizational momentum.

3. **Explicitly authorize video conferencing for all meetings.** This is essential for a national organization and reflects the reality of how distributed volunteer organizations operate today.

### Secondary Priorities

4. **Add a disbursement threshold.** Specifying when two signatures are required (e.g., above $200 or $500) provides clear operational guidance.

5. **Consider the Student and Career Development Committee model.** Formalizing mentorship, career guidance, and internship coordination as standing organizational responsibilities would significantly enhance the value SCUT Alumni America provides to its members—and to newly arrived SCUT graduates navigating US careers.

6. **Consider a pre-amendment comment period.** Allowing members to comment on proposed bylaw changes before the formal vote improves both the quality of governance and trust between the Board and membership.

7. **Establish term limits.** Adding a three-consecutive-term limit for Directors would encourage governance renewal.

## Summary Assessment

SJTU-SV and SCUT Alumni America serve closely comparable populations in overlapping geographic areas. SJTU-SV's bylaws are meaningfully more modern than SCUT's 2002 document, incorporating provisions for student membership, multiple Board meetings per year, video conferencing, term limits, a detailed committee structure, and 501(c)(3) status. The most impactful lessons for SCUT are: (1) create a Student Member pipeline category; (2) raise the minimum Board meeting frequency; and (3) explicitly authorize and normalize video conferencing as a meeting format. These three changes alone would significantly strengthen SCUT Alumni America's governance and community engagement capacity.
