# Shanghai Jiao Tong University Alumni Association in Silicon Valley (SJTU-SV)

## Overview

The **Shanghai Jiao Tong University Alumni Association in Silicon Valley (SJTU-SV)** is a nonprofit organization incorporated in California and recognized as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization (EIN: 56-2316181). It serves graduates and former faculty of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (上海交通大学, SJTU) who reside or work in Silicon Valley and the greater San Francisco Bay Area's southern peninsula.

## History and Background

Shanghai Jiao Tong University traces its origins to 1896, when it was established as Nanyang Public School, one of China's first modern universities. SJTU is today among China's top three research universities and is particularly renowned for its engineering, computer science, medicine, and business programs. It is home to more than 430,000 alumni worldwide, with a significant concentration in the United States, particularly in Silicon Valley's technology industry.

SJTU-SV was formed to serve the dense concentration of SJTU alumni working at technology companies, research institutions, and universities across Silicon Valley. The organization is supported by generous alumni contributions as well as by Shanghai Jiao Tong University itself, reflecting the university's strong interest in maintaining ties with its overseas alumni community.

## Mission and Purposes

SJTU-SV's mission is to:

- Connect SJTU alumni in Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area
- Foster professional networking and career development among members
- Support the next generation of SJTU students through mentorship, internship, and scholarship programs
- Promote academic and cultural exchange between Silicon Valley and Shanghai Jiao Tong University
- Celebrate and share SJTU's academic tradition and community spirit

## Organizational Character

SJTU-SV is structured as a small, focused alumni association with 501(c)(3) status, reflecting a primarily educational and cultural mission. Due to its revenue remaining below the IRS threshold ($25,000 annually), the organization is not required to file Form 990, keeping administrative overhead low. Its operations are driven by a volunteer board and committee structure.

## Location and Scope

The organization is headquartered in Los Altos, California, placing it at the heart of Silicon Valley. Its geographic focus on Silicon Valley reflects the particular concentration of technology professionals who are SJTU alumni—many of whom work at major firms such as Apple, Google, Meta, and leading semiconductor companies, or have founded their own technology startups.

## Relationship with SJTU and Peer Organizations

SJTU-SV operates as one of many SJTU alumni chapters worldwide. SJTU maintains relationships with over 100 overseas alumni organizations across more than 60 countries. The Silicon Valley chapter coordinates with SJTU's Alumni Affairs Office and with peer chapters in the USA, including the SJTU Alumni Association of Greater Boston and the Chiao Tung University Alumni Association in America (CTUAAA), which serves all five Jiao Tong University alumni.

## Activities

SJTU-SV regularly organizes:
- Annual banquets and alumni reunions
- Technology and entrepreneurship forums
- Career networking events
